01/02/25, 3:39 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Heyy Welcome @919884801349 Leonard Selvaraj to DNA Home! The nomadic freelancer, sailor and what not. There are no rules in DNA. You can post anything except for one rule: You must write everything from scratch just like this message. Let's the welcome rituals begin.
01/02/25, 3:41 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Saturday pre-evening, ellam thoonguvaanga. irunga vanthu Hi Solluvaanga 😂
01/02/25, 3:43 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: Welcome to the clan brooo !!! 😜
01/02/25, 3:44 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: Company secreta velliya solathinga saaatrr
01/02/25, 3:48 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Thanks for the welcome broo! @917397390737 
Small correction, I am Leonard *Selvaraja*, not Selvaraj 😁

Raj = Kingdom 
I am not the Kingdom, I am the King! Also a fun fact, I was baptised with 7 names 🤣 

I have heard alot about DNA community. Glad to be here. 

I am that one guy who does the most extreme stuff on a Tuesday afternoon. @918778045446 can vouch for it haha. Most recent obsession is sailing. But when I'm not on the water, I enjoy flying aeroplanes or miniature models of airplanes (aeromodelling). 

When I'm not doing both, I run 2 aviation SaaS startups, building apps for pilots, cabin crew and everyone else in aviation. One based out of Chennai (icrewsystems - SaaS + Service) and the other based out of Delhi (Wingman - pure SaaS). 

This year, when I made my vision board, "Community" was on it. I am trying to do a CPR on Laravel Chennai Community (a tech community). 

I'm curious and excited to be a part of DNA group. <This message was edited>
01/02/25, 3:49 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Btw, I'm not sure how vast the borders extend. I'm from Chrompet, Chennai.

01/02/25, 5:19 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Team is heavily packed in making the final movie output. No bandwidth to work on a teaser. It’s unfortunate. But it’s really a good idea
01/02/25, 5:20 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Welcome Murali!
01/02/25, 5:21 pm - Murali Sankar DNA: Any clips should be fine . No need to put in too much effort into producing a teaser video if there is not enough bandwidth

01/02/25, 5:21 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: @919629392810 director sir! Think karo and see.. you folks did the best so I really can’t push. It’s not human thing to do.

But, if one of y'all send me a video, I'll perhaps stream DNA Documentary trailer from the world's second highest ski resort :)
01/02/25, 6:10 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: or a video call, whichever one is easier
01/02/25, 6:18 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Curious to know. 

Is it a “lock yourself in the room and ship a product” trip 

Or “do unemployed guy stuff at 2pm on a Monday” trip?
01/02/25, 6:19 pm - Ar.Sameer: Hi @919884801349 

Amazing introduction.. Happy to have you at DNA! 

I'm Sameer and I'm from Pallavaram. The borders extend until Chengalpet for Chennai I guess. 

Welcome onboard. 😀

01/02/25, 7:40 pm - Barveen Kumar: He might learn 🤏  much from the book with that attitude 🤣
01/02/25, 7:45 pm - Mahesh *CFC: We call them orangutans…or “eggrangutans” 

Cuz they behave like an orangutan…and haven’t really “hatched” yet to become a functioning member of society. 

You can spot a lot of them in big communities…and usually they get timed out or suspended.
01/02/25, 7:47 pm - +91 97910 22282: *Sorry Folks*

*Do Not drink the next glass of water without listening to this Podcast*  .

One of the best podcasts in  terms of knowledge gain I personally had at BCMC. 

The water we think is safe and healthy is the root cause of many chronic health issues. 

Also it is not at all expensive to treat water as we do now. 

Thanks to the Guest Mr. Thiruvikraman of   Water Gallery.
01/02/25, 7:48 pm - +91 97910 22282: Do watch this

01/02/25, 7:57 pm - Rodick: @919791022282 Sar u read my mind , was researching about Sustainable living content when I came across a few articles on how chennai and bangalore's water is toxic asf. 

Will do more thorough research and share more deets as well
01/02/25, 8:11 pm - Ar.Sameer: Wanted to hear you talk about sustainability the other day when we met.

01/02/25, 9:11 pm - +91 97910 22282: Not just  for hook.  It's really scary to think how careless we are with regards to water.
01/02/25, 9:38 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Good night DNAians! As always feel abundance of gratitude for everything we have got. I’m grateful for today, all the conversations, all the people, the support and everything. Gratitude beats disappointment.

01/02/25, 10:46 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: My night thoughts dumping here:
01/02/25, 10:46 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: When I try to solve problems, I get away from creativity. 

Creativity and solving problems are two different things. One is about finding answers and the other is about asking new questions. I’m hungry. Let me order food. That’s problem solving. Hey, why not mix Maggie with Pizza and call it *Maggizza*? That’s creativity. 

You cant urge creativity. You can’t be creative when you’re meeting a deadline. 

To be creative you must spend time doing nothing. Not solving a problem. Not chasing a goal. Nothing. You must let the brain wander. Do its monkey thing. 

Hey, What If I put some holes in my socks and call it Ventilated socks? Haha, seriously, that’s what I’m thinking right now. I don’t know even know why I’m thinking about socks right now. But that’s how monkey brain works. It doesn’t ask for permission. There’s no reason to be and it could be nonsense. 

To be creative: Allow yourself to be nonsense. Pointless. Stupid. Idiot. Mad. Childish. All of these at once. 

Van Gogh painted like a mad man not a creative strategist. 

“Creative Strategist”, painful job to be honest. 

If your job involves being creative and solve problems, I feel both bad and good for you. You’re possible in the best job anyone ever could get but might affecting your mental health in worse ways. 

It’s like running macOS and Windows on the same machine. Technically you can do that but it is going to overheat the system.
01/02/25, 11:01 pm - +91 80988 06677: adults are kids with filters 😂.
01/02/25, 11:01 pm - Barveen Kumar: Something feels off with this take.
01/02/25, 11:02 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Yes. I agree.
01/02/25, 11:04 pm - Hari Kumaran: <Media omitted>
01/02/25, 11:04 pm - +91 80988 06677: saw the video. I seriously wanted someone to address the plastic chopping board issue, waiting for it.
01/02/25, 11:05 pm - +91 99629 87298: The Examples 😇🙌
01/02/25, 11:17 pm - +91 86789 15148: Ellarum thoonga over over 

Please thoonga over... Over
01/02/25, 11:24 pm - +91 80988 06677: When we were building a home, we spent money to get underground water tested in a lab for construction work, unfortunately not many think it is important. But this was useful since when we tested again later during summer we found our tds to double which kinda made it unsuitable even for construction. This led me to look at slag cement as an option which is supposed to have somewhat better resistance against higher tds water.

Now coming to drinking water i am still not convinced as to why alkaline water is good. 
One side says our body needs this higher pH level while others argue that stomach acid neutralizes since it is quite strong. 

From personal experience I can say that stomach acid which has very low pH is a good thing since biologically certain vitamin and mineral absorption happens only in acidic conditions and those taking regular antacids will see another set of problems.

As @919791022282 was saying in the video our ancestors way of life was in a way better than what we have now. The rivers flowing from the hills and mountains apart from gathering minerals also were ionized which made it more alkaline by default. 
Another key point is our body needs B vitamins which are generally only made by bacteria.
Almost most of the filtration techniques remove these beneficial bacteria and that is one of the primary reasons many vegetarians are deficient in b vitamins and need to resort to supplements.
01/02/25, 11:39 pm - Barveen Kumar: I don’t think creativity and problem-solving are different.

Creativity is problem-solving—just without a fixed path.

And if you push it far enough, it becomes innovation.

Like, think about the Wright brothers.

They weren’t just being "creative" for fun.

They had a problem—how do we make humans fly? No clear answers, no blueprint, just trial and error.

That’s creativity.

But when they actually built a working plane? That was innovation.

Same with Van Gogh—he wasn’t just painting randomly. 

He was figuring out how to express emotions in a way no one else had done before. Creativity.

But the way he used colors and brush strokes? That influenced generations of artists. 

That’s innovation.

So yeah, I don’t think you need to "do nothing" to be creative. Creativity happens because you’re trying to solve something.

And when that solution changes the game?

That’s when it becomes innovation.

02/02/25, 10:31 pm - +91 82485 54880: The people at DNA School were slightly above my awareness and exposure level. It took me some time to understand the vibe around me, so I hardly participated in the activities during those three days (2 days actually, I'm absent on Day-1) . Because of this, I can sense that it’s nearly impossible to spot me in even a single frame of the DNA School movie. No offense to that!

However, I believe I can learn a lot from others’ exposure, and that’s crucial for growth. So, I’m burying the small feeling of "Cha, namma oru frame la kooda perusa illa!"

First reel produced. I was procrastinating too long telling random shit like “need a tripod, need a mic, need editing tools”

so I just decided “F*ck it lemme just walk around and record” and finished recording in 15 mins whilst waiting for a cafe to open up. 

Quality is worse than a burnt potato but I’m sure this’ll improve as more practice goes. 

Thanks to @919600770424 & Iswaryaa for their 1-1s at DNA school btw. <This message was edited>

2 suggestions 
1. Captions were rolling over your face

03/02/25, 9:48 pm - +91 94429 30787: Hi guys,

I have been writing one post in Linkedin per day, for the past one week and I could see many people coming and talking with me (even people who haven't talked with me before). It felt good. It gives me a feeling that I am alive outside my house too!

I had a strong belief on 'Build in Public' and 'Documenting the Journey', but I never had the guts to do it! During the Beach walk last week, @917397390737 anna gave me a push and asked me to write one post everyday for 30 days. Now, I think I can't go back!

I am very glad that I went to the Beach walk that day, because that conversation and the push couldn't have happened anywhere else!

And above all, you know what kept me writing these 6 days? Those comments and reactions from you guys! It gave me a confidence that I am not alone and there are people with me! It's a whole different feel for me!

There is something called Micro series. Apparently they are doing great in China since last 2 years. 

Millions of views and growth.

Has this been tried for growing a business or brand? Any cade studies if you guys know.

Would want to discuss on this and learn .

04/02/25, 10:54 am - +91 97910 22282: I wanted to be a bus conductor when I was a kid. 

Assumed the smart conductor takes all the money home and that driver uncle is loosu enough to just drive and not take money 

I sincerity collected bus tickets- used ones which mom used to bring back from office.  

Safe ah, used to keep it away from my elder brother Johnny, cause he might take it and not Give me the money 

The actual plan was to collect so many tickets and one day, I would sell to passengers and make lot of money like that conductor uncle. 

The plan was perfect. I just dint figure out that, to sell the tickets,  I might need a bus or work in a company that owns busses. And the tickets have to be unused. 

One day I kinda realised that this ticket collection plan won't work, cause someone told me right on my face that this was a stupid idea. I threw away those tickets  I frustration i guess. 

Of all the things I remember from my childhood. 

This one memory still hurts. I thought I figured out my entire life ND I just had to collect tickets.

I also wanted to be an ips officer, background dancer like Johny from Raju Sundaram team, a god sent  samiyar kid who can predict future (I had people paying me once when I was  6 to 8 years old.  

Lastly I dint get mbbs, and dint want to become a dentist though u got free seat (free seat was 15k and payment seat was 50k back then).

Took architecture, have done well. Like really well I this space.

Started a business mentoring community dehub 4 years back purely  to reach business to architects and designers.  Grew some solid trust among the community .tried my best  to do all   i had d to do and grew the community.

Then I started a Marketing company as well. Last year. It's going good
.
But every now and then, I still wonder why that first idea of becoming a conductor never worked. 

Semma idea. Free tickets collected from mom.  Just had to sell them to make money  

I'd you understood the flaw in this conductor business model. 

Am sure you have all it takes to find mentoring to fix the current business problem you have.

Used tickets, afraid my competition brother wojkd steal it, dint plan the base, dint undersrbd the domain .just got an idea and acted and even at 40, the kid me is like deserved to win.

I want houseful. @918098806677 spoke yesterday and today morning again about how unnecessarily I’m being hard on myself. But I want every single seat taken. I want naked eyes struggle to find an empty space. Because — I remember the questions. The doubts people had when I told about it the first time. “Who is going to come watch this? 10-20 max. Shouldn’t  price 1000. Better call some friends and fill the seats.” I heard all of this. I wanted to prove something. A podcaster, YouTuber, anyone can build something meaningful and can dream of putting it in theatre one day. People will come. @919894593234 screen your podcast. @919600770424 screen your videos. @918838542051 screen your course. People will come. Don’t let anybody tell you it won’t happen.

If building distribution via youtube is the only way then I should save some money backup and launch my own channel and then sell my online course 


Or else as @917397390737 bro said, I'll record my course (PRODUCT) and find a way to market it.....

I should do the second way right ????


Build Product first
Find a way to market it and sell it ?!
05/02/25, 9:25 pm - Ar.Sameer: I'm just talking my case.

I didn't know business, I didn't know networking. 

I just believed what my mentor said (@919791022282) 

and 

Just started showcasing what I know. 

I didn't know the problem or solution or how to make money out of it.

Just doing these consistently, I started having people asking me to do things for them for a fee..

Did a few, made losses, understood and kept improving. 

Being in constant conversation with similar people and potential clients, I got to know where to keep my "check mate" better now. 

That's it.
05/02/25, 9:26 pm - Ar.Sameer: By checkmate I mean where clients will tackle you and you being ahead of them with a logic- that makes money.
05/02/25, 9:53 pm - +91 72000 62218: You don’t have to have everything figured out all the time.

This is something I’ve realized while exploring different things.

Some people preach their success stories, marveling at how their lives unfold. 

And then there’s me—questioning my existence one moment and completely forgetting about it the next when an important task comes up.

You can still win while wondering about your next step in life.

A little progress keeps me motivated amid the confusion, and sometimes, it’s the small wins—the little things—that shift my perspective on life.

Filled with imperfections, I’m a public speaker and an occasional writer, weaving imagination and reality through my art—while currently exploring product management alongside the marketing sector!

07/02/25, 12:34 am - Barveen Kumar: Guys, 

How many you watched Bryan johnson's podcast with Nikhil?

Bryan's walkout from the podcast raises a few questions on my mind.

Can I ask them here?
07/02/25, 2:32 am - +91 80988 06677: why not? what do you have in mind?
07/02/25, 7:12 am - Barveen Kumar: 1. If he’s so cautious about health risks, why does he still travel by airplane, where radiation exposure is higher?
2. Why was he comfortable attending an event at Antilia in Mumbai, which has similar air pollution levels, but not the podcast?
3. If air pollution was such a serious concern, why travel to India at all instead of conducting virtual meetings?
4. Does he check pollution levels before traveling to every destination, or only when it fits a certain narrative?
5. Did he join the podcast knowing he would leave early to make a statement?
6. Finally, is this the longetivity Bryan is thriving for the future where humans can only feel comfortable on a controlled environment & not on real world ecos?
07/02/25, 8:10 am - Rodick: I think he had to do so,   like attend the other events , but then got sick and tired of the air pollution and left . This is actually great coz it raises serious concerns over India's Air Quality <This message was edited>
07/02/25, 8:11 am - Rodick: He also made a Diss bout US obesity too, so we can't say he's one of those stupid foreigners who were biased
07/02/25, 8:12 am - Rodick: I'm open to opinions here, many here know much better about how millionaires operate much better than me, this needs an open conversation
07/02/25, 8:14 am - +91 63692 38898: I'm not sure about Bryan Johnson's travel routine/ agenda 

But one thing that I can't wrap my head around is his theory of "Don't Die" is primal emotion of humans

If feels so selfish, growing up in Indian culture, family is major purpose of life for many

What do you think?
07/02/25, 8:16 am - Rodick: Can u elaborate a bit ?
07/02/25, 8:16 am - Rodick: Nonetheless,  We at Climec Labs is gonna market the shit out of this 😂
07/02/25, 9:55 am - Barveen Kumar: Its becoming a agenda now? I'm still looking for 2nd question and addition to that, a serious biohacker like hin would have vetted the AQI data before coming here right? Or we have to convince that he just ignored them and wanted to see the rich culturr of our country?
07/02/25, 10:10 am - Ar.Sameer: This is the "Zero aging guy" we're talking about. 

It could be a stunt. a mutual understanding between both parties- a stunt to make it seem how important air quality is.

I see a trend where "any marketing is good marketing" as long as there's a discussion. (and we're having one)

Eg. Tamil tech youtube channel issues, kanye, this....to name a few.
07/02/25, 10:11 am - Ar.Sameer: Coincidentally we were talking about this yesterday. 😯
07/02/25, 10:12 am - Mahesh *CFC: I honestly like what he did. 

It showed how bad the AQI is everywhere in India. The ones who are crying on social media are just copemaxxers. 

Keep in mind that we have the WORST possible exposure to all forms of pollution. <This message was edited>
07/02/25, 10:18 am - Mahesh *CFC: I’m sure point 5 is true, and was intentional. 

The thing is, the “average” are now criticising Bryan for talking about pollution and taking a stand against it. 

Whilst in reality they must be supporting the act and must criticise PCBs for not enforcing pollution norms. 

Keep in mind that we already have norms and standards for all industries. We don’t need to cry to get “new” laws and stuff. 

Yet the level of enforcement is low because of corruption and bribery. 

I mean this happens everywhere. 

GCC has a responsibility to keep the roads dust free. That don’t happen. 

Trucks must not emit black smoke - no one cares about that. When was the last time you saw the police stop a truck / MTC bus for emitting 200% carbon monoxide. 

Heck even people driving Mercs and BMWs throw trash on the road. <This message was edited>

07/02/25, 11:53 am - +91 86789 15148: One question

Tmwr I'm going to break one of my fears of being perfect on camera 😅

Basically start recording videos for my Instagram page 

Suggest something I should avoid 😅 Or do 

P. S: Nervous as hell (but I don't want to procrastinate this time)

Things to avoid - procrastination
07/02/25, 1:33 pm - +91 80988 06677: narrative and bit of exaggeration, that being said i suspect it is because his experiments need to have a proper baseline to be compared to, so change in environment will cause bad data markers.
also your point 6 make sense, one thing to understand is he is trying to extend life expectancy as we are now(biologically), but unfortunately evolution or survival of the fittest theory will actually determine or set the outcome in future
07/02/25, 2:04 pm - Barveen Kumar: Yeah, rat's life can be extended easily when it's in a controlled environment 😂
07/02/25, 2:34 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I’m seeing poor reasons people have written down in volunteer forms. I’m not sure how anyone with common sense think that these answers will be picked. I’d rather do it all by myself. Rant!
07/02/25, 2:36 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: Can we see those answers 🙃

And it’s your job to pitch it in your own style — serious like @919894593234 @918838542051, funny like @919003386368, meme like @919884150664, storytelling like @918678915148 @919600770424 or @916379005589, over the top like me, tweet it like @918447545891whatever you like. 

The idea: Unfollowmenow — a button that removes all your followers every Sunday and resets your account. 

Yep, that’s the idea. 

Participate by dropping your pitch. Text, ppt, video, anything. We will frame the best ones and post on our LinkedIn page. And the winner gets the DNA best pitcher title. Your next Starbucks coffee is on us. <This message was edited>

Be free from comments like , excellent post , great one and 🙌..  

Every Sunday just like how you wind off and reset your busy week , go ahead and reset your followers and suprise them ..

12/02/25, 12:20 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: This ain't just fun, but a simple brain workout. Even if you haven’t pitched before, just drop a one-liner or a tagline. No wrong answers, no pressure. Give it a shot! 🚀

12/02/25, 12:23 pm - Barveen Kumar: UnfollowMeNow: The Art of Vanishing

Every Sunday, your followers disappear. Poof. Gone. No explanations, no goodbyes, no “I thought we were friends.”

Just a clean slate, like a monk, but for your digital soul.

No lingering acquaintances from 2006. No algorithm studying your every move.

You get to exist online without the weight of yesterday’s audience.

Why?

Because social media is just high school with worse outfits.

You think you're building a legacy, but really, you’re curating a museum of past versions of yourself.

Time to burn it down. Rebuild. Repeat.

For the thinkers: If your posts reset every week, do you post differently?

For the radicals: If influence isn’t power—disappearing at will is?

For the tired: Maybe freedom isn’t found in more followers, but in fewer.

Tap the button.

Let them go.

See what happens.

Unfollow(Me)Now.

12/02/25, 5:04 pm - +91 72000 62218: Everything has a time period.
From morning coffee to late-night scrolling, habits come and go.

And when you push things beyond their time, regret finds its own way in—with its own set of consequences.

Just like the divider in your geometry box—taking up space without real use—some people on social media do the same.

You might have followed many people, but not every strategy or trick works for everyone. What worked for them may not work for you. And over time, all that noise might have made you forget why you followed them in the first place.

That’s why I reset my account every Sunday.

To keep things fresh. To engage with new people. To make learning more dynamic.

So here’s your chance—unfollow me now.

 I’ve taken up space in your feed for a while. Maybe I made an impact, maybe I didn’t.

If I've made an impact and your life got better by 0.01 I'm happy keep progressing all by yourself or few other people :D

If I've failed to create an impact I'm sorry, you are yet to be inspired by a lot of people.

Unfollowmenow

Either way, next Sunday, it all starts over.

Your time. Your space. Your choice.

12/02/25, 7:40 pm - Mahesh *CFC: If you’ve been on LinkedIn for a while, I’m sure you’ve seen these somewhere in your posts

- This is absolute gold! 🚀🔥 Totally aligns with my thoughts on synergy and innovation in today’s fast-paced ecosystem! Thanks for sharing
- ⁠Love this perspective! In today’s ever-evolving landscape, it’s crucial to leverage AI-powered solutions to drive scalable impact across industries. Great insights!
- ⁠Completely agree! Empowering leaders to elevate their mindset and optimize for success is the key to driving transformational growth in the digital era. Well said!

LinkedIn clearly has two things. 

1. You - the GOAT, an absolute god. 
2. ⁠NPCs. AI-generated vomit bots. Engagement leeches trying to slide in.

When your content gets hijacked by these empty buzzword zombies, the LinkedIn algorithm pushes your posts to more people just like them. 

And suddenly, your audience is a graveyard of people who don’t think, don’t buy, don’t challenge you.

Your real audience, the ones who might hire you, partner with you, fund you will NEVER even see your content.

Well…you can’t take your whole list and find who’s good and who’s bad right?

So, what’s the fix?

ATOMIC BOMB.

A nuke. For ALL of your followers. 

One click. 

Every follower wiped out. No more bots. No more “thought leaders” who never think. No more corporate poetry clogging up your feed.

Your engagement drops…for a while…but when you build back, your influence skyrockets.

Because a thousand fake followers are worth NOTHING… 

But ten new people who actually give a damn are probably worth millions…

And the algo now pushes your content to thousands of people who give a damn. 

DM me for the nuclear codes. 

Once you press the button, there’s no going back. You’ll have revelations that you never thought of. 

It’s time to fix your profile for good

12/02/25, 8:11 pm - Ar.Sameer: I want to share it as my LinkedIn post too. Would it sound too rude?
12/02/25, 8:11 pm - +91 86789 15148: Let it be... Share it 😜
12/02/25, 8:12 pm - Ar.Sameer: Tomorrow's post!! 😁
12/02/25, 8:12 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Let it. We need to do something about the mind numbing rot in there.
12/02/25, 8:13 pm - Ar.Sameer: May be actually get to lose a little followers who don't find the wavelength right? 🔥
12/02/25, 8:13 pm - Mahesh *CFC: One our our content goals for Feb 2025 to switch to an IG centric approach and just repurpose content to Lonkedin.
12/02/25, 8:13 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Unironically that worked way better than writing text “for” LinkedIn for the first few tries.

Now I’m just practicing TTC and self recording more based on feedback I got. <This message was edited>
12/02/25, 8:19 pm - Ar.Sameer: We're trying the opposite.. LinkedIn into IG. Kind of works. One of them worked very well! 

Still learning. Facing the camera can push it further more I guess. 

Just posted a new one leaving the idea to people's thinking...


Would love to share here...

12/02/25, 8:21 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Good hook. But I would say you could add more action and some form of a story in the graphic. Like tell people “why” they must drop whatever they are doing and pay attention.
12/02/25, 8:21 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Honesty my mind is so cooked that I was prepared for a Peter Griffin / Brainrot jump scare at the firework
12/02/25, 8:22 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Those AI cat reels do a good job at this IMO
12/02/25, 8:23 pm - Ar.Sameer: I'm not in for Brainrot and I'm refreshing the instagram explore every week. It brings 

"I'm putting chilly powder into my eyes. Please like my video" every few days.
12/02/25, 8:24 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I’m using my personal IG only for brainrot and dark humour. I’m restarting my biz account separately for marketing content and pushing lead gen ads out.
12/02/25, 8:24 pm - Ar.Sameer: I know a guy who's been called to stay on a complimentary vacation at a well known Resort and use the cat idea to do a catfluencer reel 🥲
12/02/25, 8:25 pm - Mahesh *CFC: My feed is 95% brainrot and 5% Harvey Specter because one particular DNA member wouldn’t stop sending me reels about Suits.

12/02/25, 9:48 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA changed the group name from "DNA Pitches a terrible idea" to "DNA"
13/02/25, 9:18 am - Ar.Sameer: What is so laughable @918838349004 ?
13/02/25, 9:20 am - Barveen Kumar: Oops! Wrong reaction 😅 @919952936003 bro
13/02/25, 9:20 am - Ar.Sameer: Cool bro. Thought you had some concrete facts on how it won't work as a building 😄
13/02/25, 9:22 am - Barveen Kumar: Nooooooo....... I've been wondering that beauty and also thinking why people are not expressing their wealth with this kind of art 😑
13/02/25, 9:26 am - Ar.Sameer: Vision for starters bro. Then money and so on. 🥲

We'll eventually get there as we are slowly getting to see mass public understanding how important space design is- rich and poor. 

Never have I felt easy explaining concepts/floorplans for residences and get them accepted in the first presentation itself as in the last 3 years.
13/02/25, 9:28 am - Barveen Kumar: I hope people will inherit art along with their lifestyle like how we did before 70's & 80's 🖖
13/02/25, 9:32 am - Ar.Sameer: Art or in another words "Aesthetics" belongs to how much time we give for a product to be made.

Slower the time taken to build something, intricate it was. 

Now it's all fast forwarded. 

There are some people who use the right term for a style from particular time. 🙂
13/02/25, 9:34 am - Mahesh *CFC: We need aesthetics back fr. But the current Indian “average” building aesthetic has to die a horrible death. 

Most buildings around us are an absolute eyesore to look at. It looks worse than the 70s soviet depression aesthetic.
13/02/25, 9:34 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: One day I wish I accept people as they are. I accept humans are humans. I walk into people, and I see them selfish, arrogant, or ungrateful— and I feel absolutely okay with it and accept them. The sooner the day comes, the better the community leader I become. I have begun to accept to so many things in life, qualities of people, what makes humans human but these three have been taunting me. Makes me so angry and frustrated. The day I accept these three, I become a better person and life shall be peaceful. What are the qualities in people bothering you? Just a thought for the day. Today evening we have something happening at DNA
13/02/25, 9:35 am - Mahesh *CFC: Space design + horizontal development 

That’s why you see places like that big footpath in Pondy Bazaar T Nagar and Church Street “feel” better than every other area. <This message was edited>
13/02/25, 9:37 am - Ar.Sameer: 90% of the homes we see here are not done by an Architect and are built as is. 

It's a discussion for another day. 

Pondy bazaar feels different because it was redone by urban designers to respect the pedestrians as much as the drivers/riders. 

That respect is all what design requires. ❤️
13/02/25, 9:43 am - Ar.Sameer: Very important discussion!

I like people who behave like an acquaintance and stay as is.

I also like people who behave like family and stay as is.

It bothers me to have people who talk as if we're family and behave otherwise. This confuses me and annoys me fully. It stays on one side of my brain and it's not easy to switch that thing off until I block them everywhere. 

Felt better doing so.
13/02/25, 10:03 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Well blocking is escapism. Accepting them as they are is brave.
13/02/25, 10:04 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: The day you can have a coffee chat with someone you don't like and share a laugh is when you mastered art of working / living with people.
13/02/25, 10:13 am - Ar.Sameer: Awesome!! I take it now!
13/02/25, 10:24 am - +91 99990 86253: What happened? An idea, a really bad idea was shared.

13/02/25, 10:43 am - Barveen Kumar: But how long can we do this?
How long can we accept?
Where will that threshold lies?


I've been thinking about that as well.
13/02/25, 10:44 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Until you live on this planet where humans are the ones who make you food, talks to you, gives you comfort.
13/02/25, 10:49 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Hey DNA people, it will be nice of us to repost this, tag friends and ask them to take a look. @919999086253 has been putting in lots of efforts and this shall be the reward to it.
13/02/25, 10:51 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: And big congratulations to @918447545891 and @919003386368 for winning the title , best pitcher of DNA
13/02/25, 11:16 am - +91 86789 15148: Did anyone saw it?

13/02/25, 11:18 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: White labelled solution. They have renamed it as franchise. @919791022282 SSR has a list of products he does this with.
13/02/25, 11:20 am - Barveen Kumar: So if I secure a pincode, no one else can be assigned to that franchise opportunity! 

I'm eager to see how well that works!
13/02/25, 11:25 am - +91 97910 22282: This is just affiliate model. Not even white labelled. 

Not sure whats with this pincode thing.

Whatever it is, it sure us catchy...

Pincode and franchise.
13/02/25, 11:34 am - Barveen Kumar: It sounds like a white-labelled but kinda 'semi' because we can fix the pricing for different subscription tiers as well.
13/02/25, 11:37 am - +91 97910 22282: I assumed white labelling means, rebranding it with our brand name .
13/02/25, 11:52 am - Barveen Kumar: Yeah, that as well SSR. But, not sure whether Sure is enabling that, no such information available on the post.
13/02/25, 1:33 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: <Media omitted>
13/02/25, 1:38 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: It still feels like a dream. Here’s a clip of @919884150664
13/02/25, 2:10 pm - +91 97910 22282: https://workfast.ai/
13/02/25, 2:11 pm - +91 97910 22282: I checked their features.

Not sure what I am missing but I don't see any ai features or mention of it.

The features are that of a crm , workflow or task management...
13/02/25, 2:11 pm - +91 97910 22282: Tech experts..  can you guys help where am wrong?
13/02/25, 2:15 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: @918098806677
13/02/25, 2:20 pm - +91 99629 87298: <Media omitted>
13/02/25, 2:28 pm - +91 80988 06677: if their website says nothing in ai then there is nothing ai there at least for now.

maybe they plan to add in future or they already have it why is it not on the site. 

To me the product looks like it is trying to get people to move their project management to this tool as a first step. and maybe try to build on this data later.
13/02/25, 2:32 pm - +91 80988 06677: project management is a tough market to penetrate and stay relevant for years but once you get few deals in 200+ employee companies things might go well for them
13/02/25, 2:59 pm - +91 77085 78300: With respect to this blog , I think this will be a tool where you use it mainly for project management activities and at the same time ai feature comes into place where you have to feed in data, the data can be inform of reports or any other. So using the data feeded the model will evolve and will give the output . Like in case where the ceo has to find the last months profit or any other details .. also one has to note that the quality of the output only depends on the input data you feed on regular basis.
13/02/25, 3:00 pm - +91 98841 50664: 😁😁

all of this would just need Google sheets no? 

An LLM maybe overkill?
13/02/25, 3:50 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Also, I want to ask this: 

Is anyone facing a people issue where AI us being used for the most basic of the basic things?
13/02/25, 3:50 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Was about to type a rant about slapping AI onto every fucking thing this but my mind drifted back to work
13/02/25, 3:52 pm - Mahesh *CFC: g o o g l e 

s h e e t
13/02/25, 3:52 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: And one thing I've observed is...it's better to leave a few things without the touch of AI, and something even without the touch if Automation. 


Eg: We had an automation that would send an AI generated sonnet as a birthday message based on the recipients personality...
13/02/25, 3:53 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Curios to also know how HUMANS in my circles are using AI, and for what exactly
13/02/25, 3:55 pm - Mahesh *CFC: We use a custom proprietary AI for strategic planning and copywriting…but WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY different than whatever playbook you’d find online. 

Me and the devs want to keep it to ourselves for a while and then ship out a product once we’re able to build the same rule sets and knowledge into an analytical model (eg o1)
13/02/25, 3:56 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: This is for work, la? 

Anything in personal life?
13/02/25, 3:58 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Personal life - I’m trying to use it to track workouts and then create spreadsheets about it at the gym with all parameters. 

My use case is - hey I did all this. Please put it into a spreadsheet, then take my existing records, find RPE, RIR, and automagically suggest where to progress next time.
13/02/25, 3:58 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I’ve tweaked my business bot to do the same. Actually starting it from tomorrow.

14/02/25, 11:27 am - Meenank Minnu: Imagine being featured in a book, in a movie, and as a professor. 
That's my life, when Deepak walked into it. 

I met him one day at his event,
and had coffee & dosa - diff combination, that's how Deepak plans it. 

The next day, I'm telling all the work that I'm doing about LinkedIn. 
He then challenges me to write a LI post that becomes the most liked ever, and I kinda cheat. 

It was fun, but I won the bet. 

So yes, that's me, doing LinkedIn, getting leads for the agency I work in. 
Helping others in the team to post on LinkedIn. 

Helping people create content, 
because posting content online is what gave me this exposure and this easy of a life. 

I want others to have it as well, it comes when you share your work, and allow others to be the judge. 

So, go share your work, and follow me to learn how to share your work. ❤️

14/02/25, 12:18 pm - Hari Kumaran: My name is Hari Kumaran

Book Title- The Hustler’s Detour: Big Ideas, Last-Minute Execution

From- Madipakkam, Chennai, India

Started as a courier boy, did customer support, built startups, crashed a few, rebuilt, ran a digital marketing agency, and am now, figuring things out next startup. I jump between ideas like a monkey on caffeine but somehow always land on my feet. Love building, scaling, and solving problems—just, you know, after a few rounds of procrastination.

Jack of many trades, master of figuring things out on the fly. I can talk about AI, growth hacking, personal branding, movies, cricket and many more.

If my book was on your shelf, it’d have half-finished chapters, scribbled notes, and probably a “coming soon” on the last page—because deadlines and I have a complicated relationship. But when it’s go-time, I make things happen.
14/02/25, 12:27 pm - Rodick: And if  my life was a book it'd be

 Classroom to Boardroom: How I Hustled My Way to the Top (Without a Degree in Boredom)

As a former environmental engineering student , I dropped out of engineering coz I wasn't making the impact I wanted to  and joined a new age business school called Institute of Venture Building (IVB) where I'm building upon sustainable entrepreneurship
14/02/25, 12:42 pm - Ar.Sameer: Vanakkam DNA,  

I’m Sameer, an Architect from Chennai. I’m one among the first to use AI into the Architectural design pipeline, and I’ve been documenting all of it since 2 years.  

Been an introvert all my life, LinkedIn helped understanding people and made me curious. Slowly, I started connecting/conversing with folks everywhere.  

That’s how I bumped into Deepak. We first chatted about Scrollme… then his book for which we met on 31st Dec 2024, and now here among you. Can't wait to experience DNA village!

I love movies, cooking, and always Architecture.  

I’m a visual guy..sensorily hooked. 

Good films, deep talks, fresh smells, solid friends—they fuel me. They’re my “system” to thrive. These push me further. 

If there’s a book with my name? 
“There Was Once an Overthinker.”

Would love to speak to each one of you at DNA! 😀

14/02/25, 12:43 pm - +91 90944 04174: Hi DNA Family!

Myself Arunachalam S - From Kodambakkam, Chennai

Book Title: Believer

Why Believer? Because life tested me early, but I never stopped believing. 

At 18, I faced heartbreak when my parents left, leaving me to figure things out on my own. Instead of breaking down, I built myself up. From clearing NEET to choosing my own path, from launching a business to helping others grow, I’ve lived by one thing, faith in myself and my vision.

That belief led me to build Social Sculpt, a personal branding and growth marketing agency. From working in print-on-demand to managing teams at 23, and now scaling brands through content, strategy, and AI-powered tools

Whether it’s personal branding, marketing, or just life itself, I believe resilience and consistency can turn any story into a success story. 

That’s why I’m here, that’s why I do what I do.

Now, let’s see what stories the rest of DNA has to tell!

_CTRL + ALT + SCALE: From Code to Cloud – Build, Automate, Observe_


Hello everyone- This is Saravanan 

I’m an employee turned Entrepreneur - because I’m bored of regular grind of corporate life and wanted to get into something that satisfies my passion & inner self.

Most importantly- I've started CloudEngine Labs Private Limited (cloudenginelabs[.]io) on a vision to show to my kids that doing something passionate can be helpful to what we really like to do and it's also a way to attain wealth. 

My goal for the company is to help software product development startup to do build and deployment using automation to get better ROI. We do services and developing software products in the areas of DevOps and Cloud.

I can talk the language of tech and automation spontaneously. 

Happy to be part of DNA Community.

14/02/25, 4:26 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Just in: DNA Movie trailer dropping shortly. Treat to watch!
14/02/25, 4:39 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Just went to office. Sorry for the delay here in introducing myself. Something crazy happened on the way.

I was sitting in my car, stuck in traffic, when suddenly…the dashboard flickered, the steering wheel folded in on itself, and I was thrown out

The entire car then stood up.

I barely had time to react before my Tiago...

TRANSFORMED INTO A GODDAMN AUTOBOT.

I scramble out of the seat as my car, now standing 20 feet tall, looks down at me, eyes glowing.

Then, in a deep robotic voice, it says:

“Mahesh… do you know what all successful businesses have in common? Like EVERY company that scaled and sustainably grows?”

I stare. “Uh….idk?”

The Autobot shakes its massive metal head. 

"No, fool. They ATTRACT opportunities. They don’t chase. They build systems that pull in the right people, the right deals, the right clients, without begging, without pitching to 100000 people , without wasting time on unqualified leads."

Then, just as quickly, the car shrinks back down…like nothing happened.

And that’s when I had a BIG revelation. 

EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS on earth that’s profitable and scales do this.

They have well written and designed marketing EVERYWHERE that pulls in the right people, the right deals, the right clients. 

And fun fact is that’s EXACTLY what I do.

14/02/25, 7:19 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: DNA Intro Day Recap 🚀

Some of you introduced yourselves, and a bunch of them were fantastic—@919442930787 Anu, @919629392810 Vishwanathan, and @919384488667 Rodick, you guys set the bar high. Loved the energy, the stories, and the way you owned your space. That’s how connections start.

Now, for those who didn’t participate—things get busy, I get it. No pressure. But I will run this again, maybe even over GMeet to make it more interactive. When you’re in a room full of smart, ambitious people, the least you can do is make your presence known.

But let’s be real—if you stayed silent because of shyness or because you think “People already know me” or “I don’t need to introduce myself”, that’s a mindset problem. The most successful people I know keep reintroducing themselves, keep showing up, keep making sure the right people know who they are.

“A silent presence is the easiest to forget.” If you want to be part of something meaningful, be seen, be heard, and contribute.

Until next time.🧬🔥 - Community Man.

17/02/25, 11:25 am - +91 82485 54880: Whenever we start a new channel, YouTube will boost it initially......
Then based on our consistency it grows....
In case we failed to post content consistently from day 1, it won't suggest our channel to many..... slowly it becomes dead ....hard to revive it again....
So keep posting content....
Maybe try posting shorts or small clips...... <This message was edited>

17/02/25, 12:28 pm - Hari Kumaran: +1 Deepak, many of us would have had that thought. When I went to my native six months back, I felt I should move there permanently and enjoy the nature and calmness without much chaos.
17/02/25, 12:30 pm - Enchipsu: No, the idea of moving to a 2nd or 3rd tier city might see lucrative. Dont do it.

-from a guy who did that 6 years ago
17/02/25, 12:30 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: Why every aspiring people have this thoughts!? May be the system is not suitable for everyone?
17/02/25, 12:30 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: The ecosystem has very few good people left. I was just talking to them this morning too. I am afraid of living here. Or living long enough to become a villain. May god be kind on me and help me go home.

Slowly working on it. But as you said it’s not easy though
17/02/25, 12:32 pm - Aakash J Fashionprenuer: Weather ?!
17/02/25, 12:32 pm - Barveen Kumar: You might think you want retirement, but I don't think you can. You mind won't rest.
17/02/25, 12:42 pm - Meenank Minnu: Depends on the place. 

Chiang mai is a digital nomad hub, Bangkok is like new York, Krabi is a little quiet, and koh Samui etc are too remote.
17/02/25, 12:42 pm - Meenank Minnu: Phuket is unpredictable weather
17/02/25, 12:45 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I think, this would be great for someone who's all fired up. For someone who wants to take it slow, i.e hinting at retirement and all, this would back fire don't you feel?
17/02/25, 12:45 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: @917397390737 Ladakh poirukeengala?
17/02/25, 12:46 pm - Meenank Minnu: Ladakh is too extreme for a south indian
17/02/25, 12:47 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Agreed, yet I go every year.
17/02/25, 12:47 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: but, where is this coming from @917397390737?
17/02/25, 12:48 pm - Meenank Minnu: I think the opposite would happen. 

Like deepak is currently bored, wants to retire. 

Thailand has mountains and beaches to choose. 

Places where too many come or places where no one goes.

Also, new culture, new people, maybe picking up an entire new hobby like surfing, muay thai, or diving
17/02/25, 12:48 pm - Meenank Minnu: 0 boredom for the next 1-2 years easily

Me being a tech blogger and fan of text content writing - I feel that i still need to catch up on posting more content in twitter and newsletter !!

19/02/25, 9:27 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Welcome @919176677747 (Subhash) to DNA home. Partner at Haute Arts, transforms public and private spaces through art. Do tell us all more about you. And there are no rules in DNA. Except one rule: you can’t copy paste, you must type everything from scratch. Just like I’m doing now. Welcome home.
19/02/25, 9:33 am - +91 72000 62218: Welcome @919176677747 to Namma DNA Family!💥
19/02/25, 9:34 am - Rodick: Welcome @919176677747  to DNA ! Curious to know more about you and your art
19/02/25, 9:41 am - +91 91766 77747: So, no rules… except for one rule. 

That’s like saying: 
‘Do whatever you want, just not that.’

Alright, I’ll roll with it. No copy-pasting, scout’s honor. 

But if my fingers slip and muscle memory takes over, well……let’s just say old habits die hard. 😬

Looking forward to this rule-free (but also kinda rule-bound) adventure!

I thought let me start with this ‘witty’ one and ponder and tippy type on what I want to write about me. 
 Will post it later today 

Aside to  @917397390737 : 
My name is spelt : Subash, without the ‘h’ 😎

We fight and argue every single day. And that’s exactly how we protected each other and held this company together. The folks who started with us, raised 4x 5x funding than us are gone, shut (no disrespect to them) and here we are together, happily doing what we love. A lot of co founders fight and wonder if others do too. Yes they do. But there must be psychological system in place. Something you practice. This is ours. Dey Venkat I’m naming this “Ne Solluvada” Framework. Dedicating it to you.

But is it going to be random ideas? No, *there is a plan*. I’m taking the lessons from my past, I’ve hit $100k ARR in the past, spoken to founders, marketers best in space and now getting that into action. But I know the plan isn’t the one that makes it work, it’s the execution. So, I’m giving away my plan for free.

20/02/25, 11:09 am - +91 97516 72013: Can we mention movie here?
20/02/25, 11:10 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Sure why not, we will add the trailer to the playlist then? @919999086253
20/02/25, 11:11 am - +91 97516 72013: Movie name: The secret life of Walter mitty.

Reason: It's okay to be not okay and then how things might turn up.

Every problem has a solution
20/02/25, 11:13 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Woah! Then you must loved our documentary first line. @919629392810
20/02/25, 11:14 am - +91 97516 72013: Yeah I noticed it, felt a goosebumps🙃
20/02/25, 11:15 am - +91 86789 15148: But mine are not available in YouTube 😅😅
20/02/25, 11:15 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: You’re damn outlier. I give four options you come up with fifth every single time… okay mention any link
20/02/25, 11:17 am - LS - icrewsystems.com: My recommendation to the list: 

Joe Rogan & Naval Ravikant - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44
20/02/25, 11:19 am - +91 86789 15148: What to do... I have movies and series but they are in youtube completely, plus they are not the regular growth types too... They are rom-com Or commercial ones 🤣
20/02/25, 11:19 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: I would like to recommend this beautiful video I watched a year ago but I still remember it very well. 57 years apart! Two people 57 years apart in age have a conversation. This changed the way I think about life and people. There are two people on the screen but to me it felt the same person years apart. https://youtu.be/BqSxjmvXzzY?si=89ib4DPhqclOpQHU
20/02/25, 11:19 am - +91 94429 30787: Mine too! Here's a small TED talk that makes me cry everytime I watch. Everyone should watch this. It's so deep. I get answers to why I self-blame myself when things go wrong and also insights on how I can keep up a good relationship with people around me, be it my child, my husband, or people I work with.

20/02/25, 11:36 am - +91 86789 15148: My list 

Lucifer - series - Netflix 

Why to watch - for me it broke some inner doubts and felt light hearted conversations

Second - neeya naana - adopted babies and their parents - Hotstar

https://youtu.be/I1-nT9GQ8ag?si=XFMHKMafLYwtuowj

Third - 7years of storytelling in 54 minutes by Phillip humm

Why to watch -

It is teaching me to be better storyteller everyday

20/02/25, 11:41 am - Rodick: Lucifer🔥
20/02/25, 12:00 pm - Barveen Kumar: Since I'm sharing two podcasts today that gave me immense knowledge till now, I'm gonna ignore my SERIES suggestion:

1. This particular episode from Diary of the CEO - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVVe2rCHtN0

(It taught me more about perspective & perception. And, that changed a whole lot of things in my life)

2. Casual but wonderfully curated episode by our OG Podcaster - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ8gQr7AQzU

(When I focused a lot on building a product, this episode made me expand the path and think apart from the product as a first time/generation entrepreneur. I don't normally listen to podcasts while driving my bike, but this episode kept me hooked and I was watching this episode while driving to Chennai on my bike to attend the DNA School event. And again, I've rewatched this to absorb more as well as to take notes after the DNA school event.)

3. One of my fav mov I always carry within myself - DADA (by Ganesh K Babu)

(It's about how a boy turned into a man when situation & circumstances made him into) <This message was edited>
20/02/25, 12:04 pm - Saravanan cloudenginelabs.io: Our thoughts can shape our life , our belief system relys on how we are thinking ! 

We have to be very much conscious enough to know “where we are putting our thoughts and have awareness of where we are spending our energy”

Dr. Joe Dispenza has created awareness of tuning the subconscious mind and authored books on this topic 

This pod cast of Jay Shetty with the author Dr.Joe Dispensa is one of favourite podcasts

20/02/25, 12:06 pm - Barveen Kumar: Interesting
20/02/25, 12:08 pm - Barveen Kumar: Yeah bro, host has very good and intellectual collection podcast content. I can go on and on by list a lot of em. But since we only have to list 3, I've shared the one which impacted my life a lot.

His podcast with Huberman was casual but gold nuggets.
20/02/25, 1:25 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Another recommendation from my side would be this: https://youtu.be/1lEnMmH9qh4?si=4Wquyrh-CfuSs9xZ a very short one. More than the answer look at the way he answers. The akward silence.

20/02/25, 1:32 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Oh! The OG video.
20/02/25, 1:33 pm - Rodick: Love this
20/02/25, 1:33 pm - +91 91766 77747: I think this should be one of the things inculcated in every student and entrepreneur

Looks like I missed a lot of fun the last few days. Been traveling to Pudukkottai, Trichy and Karaikudi and working at sites..

I couldn't respond to @917397390737 bro's announcement the other day calling me and a whole lots of talents as professors. 🥺 Thanks for considering me bro. It made my day. 

I had another important call the same day. A "famous" director looked at my timid instagram reel and called for a meeting. I know little about it and I wish I can reveal but let's see if this goes to the meeting as planned.

But I'm glad what some effort on content creation can do.

Coming to the DNA movie. Loved it. It is what it says and it is what it portrayed. It held every single attention of mine and my wife and the way it was presented, edited, and everything together was just too good and we took soooo much learning in those 1.5 hours. 

Now, looking forward to the village. 😃
20/02/25, 8:03 pm - +91 72000 62218: @919791022282 congratulations Anna! Super happy for you! Many more milestones to achieve soon🚀
20/02/25, 8:06 pm - +91 86789 15148: @919791022282 congratssssss anna
20/02/25, 8:07 pm - Ar.Sameer: @919791022282 Sir. Would have taken so much time to have known a lot of things and have met a lot of people if I didn't get to know and learn from you. 

I personally still take sooo much daily from every call and meeting we have. 

Congratulations on 50K sir!! More 50,000,0000...,000 to add. ❤️
20/02/25, 8:17 pm - +91 97910 22282: More than the 50k , seeing you guys celebrate like it's your own achievements is so heart warming!

20/02/25, 9:07 pm - +91 97516 72013: Some victories feel very personal to heart and feels like our own win and this is one of such moment.

I never had a conversation with @919791022282, But still I feel goosebumps for this victory.

Finally into a good community that spreads love💯
20/02/25, 9:08 pm - +91 97910 22282: Totally trust this! 🙌
20/02/25, 9:09 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Aswin I want to take this moment and rewind back to the conversation we had before you joined DNA. You said you had bad experiences in the past and was not fully sure of DNA either.  I was very sure you’re one among us. I knew you will love it here. So, how is it now? 💥
20/02/25, 9:11 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: These are little moments where I have a big smile and feel happy. 😃
20/02/25, 9:14 pm - +91 97910 22282: You have created one awesome set of humans!
20/02/25, 9:14 pm - +91 97516 72013: Bro I really wanna thankyou for taking up that call.

The very first thing I can say is I really feel the word that you said " Friends for life".
20/02/25, 9:15 pm - +91 97516 72013: Everyone is celebrating each others victory no expectations on anyone.

All are ready to contribute whatever they can and nothing in return.
20/02/25, 9:17 pm - +91 97516 72013: Some feelings can't be expressed and this is one such💯

21/02/25, 9:08 am - +91 91766 77747: Hey guys,

Looking for MBA marketing students who wanna get some real hands-on experience in marketing.

I am part of a company that creates  art-for-architecture, Public Area Art biz, and I need help collecting data, sending emails, WhatsApp, making calls, basic outreach stuff. 

Don’t stress, I’ll guide you.

Not a paid gig, but you’ll get work experience and actually learn how marketing works (not just theory).

If you or someone you know is up for it, DM me. Let’s talk.
21/02/25, 12:02 pm - Ar.Sameer: Posted this today...

Un-Niche it Up*. My whole life is that and it’s pretty awesome. I bootstrapped once, and built the VC way another time. I prepared for civil exams. I learned it all with passion. I failed, but I learned. I produced a documentary and you know what happened. Wrote a book. Made a short film. Married the heroine of the short film ten years later. Built SaaS’s. Sold once. Building again now. Oh I was a physics teacher too. Hindustan logistics operations dashboard is designed by me. (Yep, UI designer too). There’s hundred more things left to do. I will do them all. And I invite you all to do everything you wish for too!
21/02/25, 4:12 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: The only problem is difficulty in introducing yourself and answering other follow up questions with it
21/02/25, 4:17 pm - GS Thina DNA: Nice 👌🏼
21/02/25, 4:54 pm - +91 99990 86253: I am so glad that someone said this. I am 23, and the question I get the most is "So, what is final?". I have worked in marketing, personal branding, social impact, community building, facilitation and I have enjoyed everything. Yes probably in the future I want to write a book too, build a newsletter, take workshops and I don't want them to be around one thing. Because, why? _I am not confused_ Really. I am curious, and I am proud of it.
21/02/25, 6:03 pm - Barveen Kumar: So true, I've been facing this a lot. And most of time, people who asked this question a lot 'Why are jumping around instead of rooting yourself on one thing and make it as your goal?' 

Followed by, 'when you try to catch multiple rabbits, then you won't catch any!' 

But, some people might not realise that they playground I'm on is quiet different and I'm exploring the horizons. Most of the time, I'll just nod and ignore such advices politely because that is the only way to handle such things based on my knowledge.

Aren't we allowed to work full time as marketer while building products, embrace Osho while admiring Nietzsche, explore edge computing while learning parai(music instrument), be a bike rider while riding responsibly(without disturbing the fellow travellers 😅)
21/02/25, 6:51 pm - +91 77085 78300: I totally agree with this with my heart. Few years ago before covid , ppl of my same profession in my workplace was looking at me differently for having different hobbies and the efforts I have put to do them. They only had a pale idea that you are working in IT and that should only be your major goal and nothing else . I never liked it , working for 40 years and spending a majority chunk of your life and then living the old age with sadness of not doing what I wanted to was more than a failure for me . Once covid hit , I got some time , revisted myself to an extent , understood little bit on what I should do and started doing it , now I go for cricket camp , go for a first day first show movie release , do teaching , go on vacations , plan something for my hobbies or likeness , volunteer at events , learn about entrepreneurship, go to startup events , go for cricket matches that happens away from chennai , Upskill myself and planning to learn coding and design something on my own and work on my weakness areas where I have to improve. 

When I go to the cricket camp in the morning , kids very young see me differently, my neighbours see me differently for pursuing this hobby at this age but I never ever worry about it at all ..
For me I am very much sure that I should not be only known for working in corporate job all my life and got retired in a big position instead I should be known to ppl atleast my closed ones that I took part , learnt , participated and spent time in things or lanes which I wanted to …

21/02/25, 11:00 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I asked it to give me a response to sound like a “conversation”…

And this is what I got. 

Should I be sad that AI didn’t execute  my prompt?

Or should I be happy that it actually gave a logical response that said something on the lines of “the tone/structure doesn’t matter, it’s the content inside”

Usually it would say “ok no more default GPT point stating garbage, only execution mode” and then give me a response the way I wanted now. 

Now it just said “F-you here’s what you get” <This message was edited>
21/02/25, 11:03 pm - Mahesh *CFC: This is sort of a breakthrough in my “Make AI work” journey. I made it strictly follow my requirement that must call me out whenever I’m saying something irrelevant, stupid or wrong, rather than agreeing with everything and give responses from default openAI training.

This step usually would happen only after I cry and cry and cry to it and exhaust messaging limits. <This message was edited>

22/02/25, 5:03 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Happy birthday Meenank. 

Guys, a quick win from what I learnt at DNA school. 

Signed a pre-revenue bespoke diet consulting startup.

Founder found one of the reels I posted on LinkedIn to be impressive 

They were struggling a bit with sales presentation and found that reel I put out. Got them hooked so they reached out to me. 

We’ll be helping them with content writing and sales advisory. <This message was edited>

22/02/25, 8:05 pm - Ar.Sameer: Took so much insights guys. Thanks a lot. Nice Meeting all the new members. 

I'm today years old understanding "second brain" and things. 

Loaded with information. I'll start with capacities.io

Thanks @919884801349 @918838349004 @919384488667 🙌🏼
22/02/25, 8:14 pm - Saravanan cloudenginelabs.io: Could you please give us a glimpse of whats this tool obsidian can be used for @919884801349 Leo
22/02/25, 8:17 pm - +91 88388 08443: It's more like a notion i guess
22/02/25, 8:20 pm - +91 88388 08443: I thought of using obsidian for setting up my second brain framework but it was too hard for me to understand so i chose notion instead of that
22/02/25, 8:20 pm - Ar.Sameer: Bro. Tell us about you capsizing your boat?? 😳
22/02/25, 8:22 pm - +91 88388 08443: But if @919884801349 conducting any sessions regarding how to use obsidian count me in 🙋🏻‍♂️
22/02/25, 8:23 pm - +91 77085 78300: Obsidion is like the next upgrade to notion , we would have heard about mind maps , here in obsidian it automatically connects the same word or anything you write about it and interconnect it…
22/02/25, 8:23 pm - Rodick: @918778045446 ?
22/02/25, 8:24 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Cools. Making a video now
22/02/25, 8:24 pm - +91 88388 08443: And sorry for not joining the meet today I was in the middle of travel to home from college @917397390737

22/02/25, 8:37 pm - Mahesh *CFC: It is funny like Leo said. I have footage in my phone if I remember. Let me find them to.
22/02/25, 8:37 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Dont worry, I will find it 😂
22/02/25, 8:37 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Already made the phone call.
22/02/25, 8:39 pm - Ar.Sameer: Thanks a lot!!!
22/02/25, 8:43 pm - Barveen Kumar: Guys, please give capacities.io a try. Its good than Obsidian.

I think @919884801349 might agree to that in some time 😅
22/02/25, 8:44 pm - Mahesh *CFC: TL;DR - I had to be rescued. Leo managed to right the vessel. I remember our coach having a blast making fun. 

It was actually my second capsize overall (first one was whilst ocean kayaking in Goa with my sister. Prolly about 0.8-1 kms away from the coast.) 

There, I was trapped under the kayak and managed to grab her, so my time in the water was a mere few minutes. 

Anyway, good experience, and answered the question - “do life jackets really work?” <This message was edited>

Just felt to say thanks to you all for cheering me up 😇

Not a course or something. No fees. I don’t think so one should pay for mentorship at all. Intact the mentor should invest in the mentee. That’s topic for another day. Today before the Sunday ends on a positive note, Kohli smashing a century, India winning Pakistan, I am announcing my news. I dusted C3, so I’m using that time to do this. What I seek in return? Help others. Pay it forward. <This message was edited>

24/02/25, 11:35 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Wait, isn’t this what Infosys Narayana Moorthy said to his employees and everyone went bizarre? 

What about now. Now, I see people appreciating this statement. I don’t understand. 

My one piece of advice: 
When you’re in trouble, it’s the ones you spend your weekend with, your family, will be on your side. 

These so called *backers* will be gone before you know. I ain’t vilifying them. But I’m saying: this is toxic too.
24/02/25, 11:35 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Deepak is it true that ze founder must also work during ze sleep
24/02/25, 11:37 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: 99% of the creativity comes from doing unproductive things. / when you do nothing — better. But I stick with my statement: when you are in trouble, it’s who you spend your weekends with back you. The weekday folks shake hands, nodd their head and leave.
24/02/25, 11:40 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: From what I see on Instagram reels, once people make lots of money, they go nuts and say stupid things. It’s getting difficult day after day to find idol, inspiration, leader.
24/02/25, 11:43 pm - Mahesh *CFC: My take - work is life and life is work. 

But don’t be a retard and yell at your family for asking you to hang out with them. 

Don’t be that annoying “bro work mode grinding bro grindset bro” kiddo and have zero social interaction or skills. 

Spending time with friends/family is also work. 

Those asking you not to do are either 

1. Hypocrites/dumb themselves
2. ⁠Have some ghostwriter write AI generated donkeyballs for them. <This message was edited>
24/02/25, 11:47 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Also, there’s something important for all you to know. 

LITERALLY EVERY SELF MADE RICH GUY 

Like, every single one,

Even those who got rich off of a memecoin, or gambling, or whatever. 

Has this.

Business skills. 

And part of it is maintaining your relationships with people. 

Not sitting in front of your laptop 24x7 <This message was edited>
25/02/25, 12:13 am - +91 97910 22282: Not getting into the debate of working on weekends.

But the difference between this and what NM said is simple.. 

Founders have equity.. 

 employees don't. they are paid by the hour, irrespective of what the profits are.

Founders do that extra thing,, knowing the exponential output they might enjoy in future and there is also the risk of loss as well.

That's what differentiates entrepreneurs and others.

Now, a founder asking employees to work extra is coercion and investors betting on Founders who work on weekends is a choice.. 

The founder can choose to not work and they lose the funding and they would always find another who can fund..

But the employees are left with no choice... 

Ps. My week ends on Saturday night or Sunday early morning for a year now. 🙃 <This message was edited>
25/02/25, 12:21 am - Rodick: Brilliant.
25/02/25, 12:21 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Founders have a choice of finding another fund. Employees have the choice of finding another job.
25/02/25, 12:22 am - Rodick: Not many anna, especially low level corporate employees hanging by a shackle known as a contract
25/02/25, 12:23 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Not many founders either. It’s same ball, different colour
25/02/25, 12:25 am - Rodick: I agree with Tyler saying about founders working a weekend , I'm completely against the fact of Tech Giants telling their employess to work harder only to get paid in peanuts in a so called promotion
25/02/25, 12:25 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Equity, yes. Founders have more stake in the game. It’s their baby. But still shouldn’t be forced into thinking working weekends is the way to go, right? It’s all narratives, trends, especially for the new entrepreneurs stepping in.
25/02/25, 12:27 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Work hard, extremely hard but don’t forget why you chose to work that hard. The family, kids, all of them. That’s my only advice.
25/02/25, 12:28 am - +91 97910 22282: No Deepak. I beg to differ.

Excluding the young with lesser commitments, most who have the burden would never dare to even take available leaves. Majority have no clue about the outside world. They are trapped mentally. 

I ve been with 3 large organisations as an employee before I choose to escape. I literally saw people had no clue about what they are doing and feeling less and insecure. 

Lnt was one of them. 
I put my paper when the appraisals were happening.

Aala vidunga da Samy nu I came out.

That too when we were pregnant with our first kid. 

One best decision I took. 

If I had waited one more month I woukd have got 3 lacs bonus and shares of LNT with a promotion cause I was the topper on the bell curve by a mile. 

But I would still be there and missed all the things I ve done since 12 years.
25/02/25, 12:30 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: No amount of money, billions can replace my family for me. If there comes a time, my family or my company, I will choose my family again and again. It’s when I’m low, it’s my Dad’s hand that gives me hope. It’s my mom’s smile and my wife’s backing. Few years ago, after hustling way too hard at my startup, I made this call. I work 24*7 except when my family needs me, wants me. Let me be with them at least while I still can.
25/02/25, 12:30 am - +91 97910 22282: I will never bet is different from everyone else has to work extra.

Choice vs coercion. 

Employee or founders does not matter here.

This is almost similar to,  I will not eat pork vs no one should eat beef, debate. 

They look same same but totally differnt.
25/02/25, 12:32 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: All differences boils down to that SSR. It’s a choice, and when we have enough calling it, we make it acceptable too. That’s just how society functions.
25/02/25, 12:34 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: We are all in the same storm. Some are in Yacht, some are in boats.
25/02/25, 12:34 am - +91 97910 22282: I had my immediate boss from lnt call me last week and seek help for setting up her consultancy.

I have been pushing her to step out for many years now. She was being taken for a ride for many years there at lnt. 

I also had my boss from london msg me asking help for his ofshore entity in Chennai. He checks on me often. Visited me last year in spacemush. Asks what help i want. The person who gave me the first job in London. He threw a big party for my Send off. Opened a 50 year old wine specially for me.  And dint try to hold me back when the 25 year old me said I feel stuck here. I want to go back to Chennai and do something big. Since then he has always checked.
25/02/25, 12:35 am - +91 97910 22282: We know swimming. Depth of the water does not matter to us. We have that little extra confidence to choose.

Many don't know swimming and they are stuck. 

🫣
25/02/25, 12:36 am - +91 97910 22282: Ok. Romba length ah poguthu.

Let's do a round table debate on this one day? 

Record it and release as a podcast? 🙃
25/02/25, 12:36 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Good idea. @919894593234
25/02/25, 12:43 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: It’s ideal to know swimming, all the kits necessary and jump into the storm. But that’s not what going to happen. Jump, survive, learn and move on Or, wait. Again, boils down to choice. I survived six weeks with one noodle cup a day. I didn’t know I can. But I did. Saved money, launched that first product in the air. We have fought battles we have no idea how it works.
25/02/25, 12:43 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Founders need a lot of GRIT.
25/02/25, 12:44 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Just survive the storm. You actually don’t even have to be that brilliant. Breathe and Do what you love, enough I think.
25/02/25, 12:45 am - +91 97910 22282: Hence you Are Deepak!
25/02/25, 12:46 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Prioritise family. Vitradheenga. People > Profit.

25/02/25, 7:43 am - +91 91766 77747: This is a good idea.

Going live tomorrow at 1730 IST, deep dive where we cover objection handling in sales. 

Here are the deets

Topics 

Inside, you’ll learn:
 
How to flip objections into commitments ON THE SPOT.
What to say when they tell you they know someone who can do it for free, or if they call you too expensive.
How to destroy the “I’ve tried it before and it didn’t work” excuse in seconds.
The one sentence that FORCES a decision without sounding desperate.

27/02/25, 1:11 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Hey guys, seems like IIT madras is doing a startup event. They invited me to a panel, I can’t be part of it. Namma DNA village is there. So, instead, I will recommend someone from our DNA. They have some contest for fifteen startup teams and want a judge for this.
27/02/25, 1:36 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: 9000 followers lam oru vishyama, avasarapatu na post potutano? 😅

27/02/25, 1:40 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I better delete it.

27/02/25, 2:00 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I think it’s just a vanity metric. So deleted it. But I also get your points. I feel better now.
27/02/25, 3:56 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Going live at 1730 IST today, which is about 1.5 hours from now, will share a link here 

As said already - will cover the most annoying asf sales objections and how to tackle em 

If you’ve not been to my lives here’s something to know 

We’ll not have a powerpoint…nor a “buy my course xd” in the end.

Instead we’ll have an interesting convo (with me sometimes exploding) and from now,

a running document where I type live notes. 

These live notes will be shared to all current & future attendees, and will be a running document. It means every week, we update this document with new live call content

And yes, the current plan is to have deep dive calls every Friday at 1730 IST 

(this time it’s Thursday to accomodate some of our attendees) <This message was edited>

@919543218330 bro advised to recommend someone else in my place and my content team pushed me to do a give away on LinkedIn...But didn't feel right, it would collude what DNA is trying to do. Recommended a good friend.

Brooo. 

Thanks for bringing me in to DNA village. I took a lot of brothers and sisters with me now...

Not even a second did I feel I was inferior or superior...

Giants in their industries and baby step takers coexisted together and gave and took all what we wanted. 

I want to now meet everyone in this group that I haven't met. 

This is magical. I feel like I've learnt so much in these three days. ❤️

I expect to face Monday with more happiness and confidence now. 

*Once agaiiiinnn...*

03/03/25, 10:27 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Bunch of people in India are not privileged to follow their dreams, and do what they love. Majority of us in this DNA are. I think we must show complete gratitude towards life, towards people. Just a thought for the night. Good night.
03/03/25, 10:29 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Can I help?
03/03/25, 10:38 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Just thinking out loud. 

The earliest of the communities used to sit around bonfires,
Your next SaaS is called Bonfire, 

maybe a design with a few humans, around a bonfire?
03/03/25, 10:39 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Bro you’re a designer uh?
03/03/25, 10:39 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I know how to use photoshop 😂 does it count?

Do we have a solution for the second problem he says? 

Captcha which visually impaired can't use.
03/03/25, 10:43 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: <Media omitted>
03/03/25, 10:43 pm - +91 88388 08443: what about audio captcha?
03/03/25, 10:44 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah I would certainly buy….if I ever consoomed MDMA and came across this
03/03/25, 10:45 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: 😂 Nalla illa nu direct ah sollirukkalam la
03/03/25, 10:46 pm - +91 75502 39842: Could create llm agents that will interact with web pages and make it friendly for visually impaired, like reading out loud, solving captcha, clicking buttons, based on the command given by the person via audio or typed text

03/03/25, 10:49 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I worked with a client who wanted WCAG to be followed. There are browser extensions and accessibility add-ons that do screen reading etc... but captcha, was an issue. We overcame that by using OTP based auth.
03/03/25, 10:49 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: @918098806677
03/03/25, 10:52 pm - Ar.Sameer: Do we have solution for the building accessibility problem sir?

I thought about it but it's vast. 

As what I researched, blindness doesn't mean they see dark black colours.

There are some colours that their eyes can recieve. This is across different kinds of blindness...

What if there're special paints or lights that reach them?

This is the starting point. Couldn't pursue further.
03/03/25, 10:59 pm - +91 97910 22282: Yes.  Tactile floorings.

Similar to what we have in metro stations and in high paced kithcens of star hotels..
03/03/25, 11:00 pm - +91 97910 22282: Braille signages
03/03/25, 11:00 pm - +91 97910 22282: London used to have these.
03/03/25, 11:01 pm - +91 97910 22282: One idea I have is, the visually impaired have the stick.. so automated signage can be done if the ai can pick the sound abd realise that a person who can't see is near. And have a conversation to guide them
03/03/25, 11:02 pm - +91 80988 06677: It takes a bit more effort to make a website accessible to different sets of users. 

There are very few combinations of colors that can be used and many of the colourful sites we use are difficult to use for many people. In the offline world, apart from braille, what i see is the use of few colours and more shades of brightness with different shapes.
03/03/25, 11:02 pm - +91 97910 22282: Also ai cameras... if they can detuct any audio can be triggered and that's more than enough.
03/03/25, 11:03 pm - +91 97910 22282: Smell is another strong sense that can be made use of in public spaces to show the transition. But nothing like the tactile and audio support.
03/03/25, 11:04 pm - +91 80988 06677: otp is a good alternative, we are exploring pow captchas and some detections
03/03/25, 11:08 pm - +91 97910 22282: *Just that new readers - don't get confused- we are discussion 2 problems here for visually impaired.  One is accessible designs in buildings. And one is website captcha* <This message was edited>
03/03/25, 11:10 pm - +91 80988 06677: i saw metro stations in channai having Audio induction loop, good that government is doing small things to help people
03/03/25, 11:10 pm - +91 80988 06677: chennai*
03/03/25, 11:10 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Architects / Interior Designers - from your perspective, is there any scope for accessible interiors in big public places like malls / airports to be inclusive of people who may not be blind, 

but may be visually impaired of a different spectrum (eg colorblindness or sensory issues like photophobia) 

Don’t have to answer immediately if it deviates from the topic, but I’m curious. Would love to hear your thoughts some day. <This message was edited>
03/03/25, 11:11 pm - +91 97910 22282: Light temperature and colors - if they give what's needed we can implement in these 2 aspects.
03/03/25, 11:12 pm - +91 97910 22282: We need technical input from them. We can design for that.
03/03/25, 11:13 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Understood. And is there any sorta demand for such interiors? <This message was edited>
03/03/25, 11:13 pm - +91 75502 39842: captcha cant be usually ovrriden by 3rd party apps like extensions, that's the security goal, but they do have audio captcha, mostly
03/03/25, 11:14 pm - +91 75502 39842: bro, some people are totally blind unfortunately, some are color blinded, sila set of pallete or they might require it to be more bolder and darker like higher contrast
03/03/25, 11:14 pm - +91 75502 39842: technically, cater pannanum to dif set of people
03/03/25, 11:15 pm - +91 97910 22282: Long long ago I did a charity project for a blind school..  tried lot of such new ideas... but the csr donors were not keen in most of them..

They just did that for name sake publicity..

Their reason was that the code never enforced this and hence their approval process won't allow these.

So without their knowledge... we implemented uneven tiles on the floor to mark turnings and show path, with the same cost..

Which is actually not the safest cause extra undulations is a trip hazard.. 

But the labour team did well..

Had to train the folks on this...

Checked with the management if it worked.. they said some liked it abd used it.. some could not adapt..
03/03/25, 11:16 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Might not be applicable for ALL spaces, but maybe for places where you can have better lighting without really hampering the overall experience. 

This will not work in places like showrooms where they place BRIGHT lights to highlight products.
03/03/25, 11:16 pm - +91 97910 22282: Not sure. Cause I ve never researched it.

There would be demand for everything.
03/03/25, 11:18 pm - +91 97910 22282: 1st million hit 

@919600770424 @916379005589  🙌❤️
03/03/25, 11:21 pm - Ar.Sameer: There is always a demand..

But people mellow things down and make it to the bare minimum..

"Good cause" will keep the demand and supply 100%

This is the case for any type of public building...
03/03/25, 11:23 pm - Ar.Sameer: <Media omitted>
03/03/25, 11:24 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Argghhhhhh.
03/03/25, 11:24 pm - Ar.Sameer: This building became international shame even across meme websites like 9gag
03/03/25, 11:26 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah. I’ve noticed this. Government buildings have cute renders and concepts but absolutely toss away all  finesse and aesthetics 

Reason in my mind- it always goes to the lowest bidder. 

Also if you’re free, check out the design + construction tragedy of SMVB Station in Bangalore.
03/03/25, 11:27 pm - +91 97910 22282: There is a ship shaped building in Chennai.

On omr.. 
The one road that connects omr and velachery. When you come from velachery you will see it straight.
03/03/25, 11:28 pm - Ar.Sameer: Not able to recall sir. Should check :)
03/03/25, 11:28 pm - Ar.Sameer: I definitely should. Thanks for sharing mate.

03/03/25, 11:33 pm - +91 97910 22282: Wrong choice for the proportion.

The perpendicular view never showed the full ship.

And when you drive on omr 98% won't get it.

Like let's ask our dna folks.

How many actually have seen this building and guessed that it looks like a ship?
03/03/25, 11:35 pm - Meenank Minnu: regardless the reality isn't that bad hahahaa
03/03/25, 11:35 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Ive seen and been to Holiday Inn. Never struck my mind looking like a real ship until you mentioned.

I’ve seen cruise ships and container ships up close in real life 

(and even did some…..rather safe and non life threatening activities near them with a fellow member from this community who shall remain anonymous) <This message was edited>
03/03/25, 11:38 pm - Ar.Sameer: Interesting perspective. 😃
What makes you like it?

The Architects wanted a Barracuda for some reason and what came out to be a big, fat non existent fish
03/03/25, 11:39 pm - +91 97910 22282: The fish mouth should have been closed and the eyes..  that makes it silly.
04/03/25, 8:24 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Good morning all.
04/03/25, 8:24 am - Deepak Kumar DNA changed the group name from "DNA" to "DNA Next Mission"
04/03/25, 8:26 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: DNA Village was beyond anything I imagined.

I had a plan, but I was worried about things I couldn’t control. But from 4 PM on Day 1, everything just fell into place—beautifully. I’ve done many things before, but this one is special. *Right at the top for me.*

I thought people would become friends—but they *became family.*

We gave it everything we had. By Sunday 4 PM, I was completely drained (and, honestly, fell sick right after). But now—I’m back. And it’s time for our next mission.

We’re building DNA HQ.

A real, physical space. Our own home. Right here in Chennai.

A place where:
→ Founders can work, meet, or just hang out.
→ Creators can connect, record podcasts or videos, and brainstorm.
→ Anyone can crash for the night, watch movies, or plan their next big idea.

It’s a space to create, share, and build together.

DNA Village showed us what’s possible in 3 days.

DNA HQ will be a place to do that—*every day*.

More details soon.

Let’s build this, together.

04/03/25, 1:49 pm - +91 72000 62218: Hi DNA fam! I've always wanted to try posting carousel on LinkedIn. But never tried. So I wanted to give it a try, wanted to have your suggestions 😌
04/03/25, 1:54 pm - Meenank Minnu: The carousel is good for first time
04/03/25, 1:55 pm - Meenank Minnu: But you're starting the carousel with a truth that all of us know, which kinda makes it uninteresting for people to swipe on. 

Like why should they even swipe reading such a boring statement?
04/03/25, 1:56 pm - Meenank Minnu: Next up, we don't put anything unnecessary. As its limited real estate, I don't think anyone would click on your profile link in the first slide
04/03/25, 1:56 pm - Meenank Minnu: Lastly, they're reading it on your LinkedIn profile, so why the QR code in the last slide, which I think will redirect to your LI profile?
04/03/25, 1:57 pm - +91 72000 62218: I will see how can I change it & work accordingly na! Thanks for your inputs🤌

05/03/25, 11:49 am - Hari Kumaran: Too many things in line, but focusing on working on most priority tasks for the day.

One, last week, our new venture deployed a paid pilot batch for a enterprise client on BLR, today we are going to have our commercial discussed. Fingers crossed 🤞🏻

Another, get feedback from the beta users of my product altimateguide.com and push it to next stage 👍🏻
05/03/25, 11:50 am - Saravanan cloudenginelabs.io: Just a suggestion - Nextjs is best for landing pages- its a reactjs based framework and comes with SEO capabilities.
05/03/25, 11:51 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Hari the website looks sleek! Semma — can you give access to some of us here? We will in return give a shout out about it on LinkedIn?
05/03/25, 11:52 am - Mahesh *CFC: I’m at Perambur, Chennai.  Best thing you could do is go to the gym today…

Right away if you can, but if you’re busy, right today evening, and sign up. 

Trust me 99.99999% people never start working out cuz they always say “I’ll do it from next week”
05/03/25, 11:54 am - Hari Kumaran: Sure, Deepak. Some of our members Saran, Renga, Thina are in the Beta users group, they have shared some great feedback and suggestion.

Just register on website and send me msg with the email id, will give full paid access for beta.
05/03/25, 11:54 am - +91 91766 77747: I donated 1 year subscription last year, This year I want to be more structured but don’t want to pay too much for a trainer. When I was younger I had some friends and we were like a support group and pushed each other. Plus I moved to Vadapalani and need to figure out things. 
But yes I like it when u say, just go and join.
05/03/25, 11:55 am - +91 86789 15148: What's fafo 😅

05/03/25, 11:57 am - Mahesh *CFC: Best part about lifting is - all you need is yourself.
05/03/25, 11:58 am - Mahesh *CFC: The fact that you don’t have anyone to get support from AND STILL you can get work done no matter what is key.
05/03/25, 12:01 pm - Rodick: Basically

05/03/25, 12:06 pm - +91 91766 77747: Lot of people help becoz of my white beard and shameless earnestness. I am also a Giver and love to share whatever and whenever I can. But now no shame in asking.
05/03/25, 12:06 pm - +91 91766 77747: I need a gym buddy, if you know someone in Vadapalani area or TNagar where my office is, it would be great. Thanks in advance
05/03/25, 12:07 pm - +91 91766 77747: Thank you though
05/03/25, 12:07 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I remember attaching a few links here for anyone to get started with fitness. Will find them and share it to you once I’m freed up.
05/03/25, 12:09 pm - +91 91766 77747: You can be my Gen Z guide, if you like. 
Also there is someone I am working in sustainable packaging in my BNI , I would love to introduce you both. He is around 26 or so. Maybe I can learn from you both. I am passionate about creating sustainable art  too but it’s not commercially viable, at the moment. So doing some FAFO too
05/03/25, 12:10 pm - Rodick: Haha sure would love to
05/03/25, 12:14 pm - +91 91766 77747: I am renaming you as my GenZ Guru Rodrick in my contacts.

05/03/25, 7:43 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: DNA Home, the most happening, exclusive, no-rules hangout spot for creators, dreamers, builders, artists, designers and founders. Is it a co working space? Maybe. Is it a cafe? Maybe. Is it a studio? Maybe. But surely it is a playground for the wild beings. The ones who will change the future of Chennai. Big names will walk through. Deals will get made. Ideas will be born. All from one place. If you want to be part of this, pledge. Only limited set of people. Chennai is not going to be same after DNA home. Soft Pledge here only if you’re serious about it. Else leave room for someone else. https://tally.so/r/wLk9W2 Don’t share the link with any outsiders. Don’t share the news with nobody.

I get mail from LinkedIn Editorial team about what kind of content they are looking for. Thought I could share this in our group, so if any one is interested, they can create content and increase the chance of getting picked by the LinkedIn Editorial Team.

=============
As International Women's Day on March 8 approaches, the LinkedIn News team aims to highlight content related to women in the professional world.

If you’d like to join this initiative, we encourage you to post a vertical video (no longer than 60 secs) addressing one of the following questions by Monday, March 10.

What trend do you think will define the coming year in terms of gender equity?
What do you see as the biggest challenges women face when returning to the workforce after maternity leave, and how can organisations better support this transition?
What’s the number one piece of advice you received from a female mentor or colleague that still shapes your career today?

If you are inspired by more than one of those prompts, feel free to post several videos. To make sure that your content will be taken into consideration by our team, remember to include the hashtag #IWD25.

Looking forward to seeing your contribution

07/03/25, 12:19 pm - +91 91766 77747: My 2 paisa thought on it is as following : 

I loved the depth in this, but life isn’t just about extremes. 

Flashy moments grab attention, but it’s the quiet, steady glow that keeps people engaged. 

The real challenge isn’t picking one over the other, it’s knowing when to spark fireworks and when to light a candle.

Disclaimer : I am still trying to find the answer to it……. :)
07/03/25, 12:25 pm - Barveen Kumar: Yeah, I like you perspective @919176677747. Unfortunately, we are making ourselves adapt to thrive on the flash moments a lot starting from quick commerce to short form content to simple WhatsApp texts as well.

07/03/25, 1:04 pm - +91 91766 77747: Long reply warning: 
---
I was a rigid though individual in the past. Its my way or the highway types. Always ready to rebel and always ready to do - Edhir Neechal, if i felt that I was right. Which was most of the time. My opinion about social media was : Colossal waste of time and encouraging doom scrolling ( which I have also done, to be honest, when bored or couldnt sleep) and fully accepted that the entire youth is the world is going towards ' Brain Rot' another term being bandied around recently.

A couple months ago, I came across a Social Media Personality, called Gary Vee. He is around my age but has been in the media space as a teenager. Runs a couple of privately held billion dollar empires and he claims his success to be by-product of his Social Media outreach. Long story short for someone who thought that my company being in a matured space can only benefit via Linkedin and certain extent You Tube, have had some aha moments and now understand that it is how I use the SM platform effectively and sell my Company.

And then this hit me. 

Maybe it's not about fireworks vs. candles. 
Maybe it's about knowing when to light one and when to burn the other. Because truth is? We are fireworks people now. Quick commerce. Short form content. Blink and it's gone. 

But the game? The real game? Still chess. Still strategy. Still knowing when to move fast and when to slow burn.

And keep experimenting, not be afraid to look like a total frickking fool, care a middle finger about what people think of me, not be scared to fail, fall again and again, but keep trying something new.

And the most important takeaway was, there is no single blue print to success or a silver bullet that people ( me included) keep looking for.
07/03/25, 1:04 pm - +91 91766 77747: Me please
07/03/25, 1:05 pm - +91 91766 77747: @917397390737 :  So much to unlearn and learn. So your guidance will be valuable and valued :)
07/03/25, 1:07 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Adding another link.

Problem I’ve found from a lot of online routines for beginners (like Upper Lower or Push Pull Leg) is that it’s made for the “average 9-5” guy. 

For them, their daily stress hormone levels wouldn’t be as high as entrepreneurs on *AVERAGE*. (had to highlight on average cuz there are outliers everywhere)

This routine is very useful for people like us since our stress levels are way above average. 

It is low stress + relatively same results as doing a regular routine. But the catch is you’ll have to workout 6 days a week in a row. 

https://hearusjesus.com/2017/04/24/the-best-damn-workout-plan-for-natural-lifters-advanced-training-strategy-for-natties-by-christian-thibaudeau-012717/

Edit - I would recommend you to save the content somewhere (maybe download the page)

The original free routine was taken down cuz I think publishers decided to add this as part of an ebook and they put it behind a massive restricted paywall. <This message was edited>
07/03/25, 1:08 pm - +91 91766 77747: Super high stress :)
07/03/25, 1:13 pm - Barveen Kumar: The idea of that content is make myself/others realise two things:

1. A long game without, quick wins (every now and then) will be boring and liveless
2. A firework kinda lifestyle adopting without a long game strategy will be meaningless.

Have you felt that while reading that piece of content?

"Neenga yaen book ezhudha koodadhu?"

I came in after walking on this hot afternoon, took some time to read and the words completely relaxed me..

This I see as an extended version of you questioning me Why buildings don't look traditional to their places anymore..

I also see you have the Long term lust? I have changed myself to look at things long-term and it's nice feeling the quietness..

Your narrative is amaaazing!! 

I think it'll be interesting for me to know how you see the short term goal with money and finance that you discussed with Aravindh is completely different from the long term thinking you have for other things in life?

There are 2 songs I listen to when I wanna lift myself up.

One is "oru naalil" from pudhupettai.

Second one is this one. 

A re rendition of the famous old song.

The thing is , we used to have jamming sessions in our office every now and then.

Like proper jamming sessions, with musicians, composers sound engineers on Saturday nights.

The one who is rapping is "Sago" of "semma bodhai fame".. he used to work with me 3 years back. 

Semma talent.
08/03/25, 9:18 pm - +91 97910 22282: One of the evenings, I wanted a community song for my dehub for Architects .

Except the spirit (community spirit ) I had nothing.

We tried writing lyrics , it was so bad.

Then we also had someone who composed this song.

Right there on a Saturday night.

So instead of trying to write the lyrics
08/03/25, 9:18 pm - +91 97910 22282: I told, let's use old lyrics and I used this lyrics and that's the song
08/03/25, 9:18 pm - +91 97910 22282: This was rhe first take!
08/03/25, 9:18 pm - +91 97910 22282: We never reworked on this
08/03/25, 9:19 pm - Rodick: Vidunga na, Channel those emotions with the bat and make our team win 🙌 💪
08/03/25, 9:19 pm - +91 97910 22282: The dream was to relase this as an independent album song.

Sing, dance and choreo and release.

3 years ah I never share this with anyone.

Even @919952936003 does not know this na pathukonga
08/03/25, 9:19 pm - +91 97910 22282: Just wanted to share here.
08/03/25, 9:20 pm - +91 97910 22282: See you all in the cricket match tomorrow.
08/03/25, 9:20 pm - +91 97910 22282: Deepak is still sick.

But
08/03/25, 9:20 pm - +91 97910 22282: I ve asked him to come atleats like Prakash Raj of M.kumaran Mahalakshmi and thala has agreed!
08/03/25, 9:21 pm - +91 97910 22282: This is the spirit of freedom ! 

That's how I feel atleast
08/03/25, 9:21 pm - +91 97910 22282: Sago Aka Danny is in Thailand now. 

He is the actual guy who made this song possible.

I wanna release this some day as an album. Dance. And sing and release!
08/03/25, 9:22 pm - +91 97910 22282: And that was the first take! 

We were high on music that night!
08/03/25, 9:23 pm - +91 97910 22282: @917397390737 I would like to dedicate this one to you.

Sick but planned a cricket match.

Made a poster as well.

But thala dint even realise tomorrow is finals of champions trophy.
08/03/25, 9:23 pm - +91 97910 22282: The spirit you carry is amazing!
08/03/25, 9:23 pm - Ar.Sameer: Loved the song!

Semmaya paadi irukaanga.

11/03/25, 11:29 am - Mahesh *CFC: I usually go to Reddit communities to get human opinion 

And the problem is, everyone hates Elon there by definition, like some f-ing hivemind, 

so any neutral / positive opinions on Grok get downvoted and reported to oblivion. <This message was edited>
11/03/25, 11:35 am - +91 91766 77747: That’s disturbing to hear. He is a maverick and I thought we all loved mavericks! 
Ok at least I do! 
These are the people who have the cajones to buck the narratives.
11/03/25, 11:35 am - +91 91766 77747: I haven’t used Grok but I have heard good things about it. Maybe worth a shot
11/03/25, 11:38 am - +91 86789 15148: I have tried but didn't find it  upto my expectations on the previous version.. This I'm yet to check
11/03/25, 11:39 am - +91 80988 06677: even grok has issues with filtering content against elon and his interests.

I wish llms are uncensored, but issues with that are too negative. The least i wish is that they should not have built in political bias
11/03/25, 11:46 am - Barveen Kumar: One thing that I've observed by trying multiple chat interfaces(LLMs) is that all of them are trained on biased data. Just because Grok can use language, that doesn't mean it's reliable.

Every LLMs has some perspectives on their own based on the biased data they fed on. My take is, trust it when it's on the top of the iceberg level.

Check these article to know more: https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/

Disturbed AI Research Institute: https://www.linkedin.com/company/dair-institute/ (a much needed one before tech giants gulps masses with their propaganda)
11/03/25, 11:49 am - Barveen Kumar: I think Grok's macho approach is all pure marketing stunt to get the word out on the internet. When we take that attitude from Grok, rest of things seems like same or near to same with its peers.

Ofcourse, there might be some benchmark exception where Grok might've met high time than the others. Still, its just another construct getting good at predicting the next possible words to form a proper sentence.

Now, what I did was upload a lead magnet I had and just asked it to generate a blog following the PAS structure. Didn’t really do any prompt engineering
11/03/25, 11:51 am - Mahesh *CFC: This is quite better than what ChatGPT vomits. That’s my first take. Also, there’s more active voice than passive voice. Still, the flow and storytelling can be improved.

I can also see it didn’t follow any “structure” like ChatGPT. No H1-H2-H3 or bullet points. This is something I like. <This message was edited>
11/03/25, 11:51 am - +91 80988 06677: i agree that data fed would be biased but the main problem is engineers trying to correct the bias.

sometimes i just want it to reflect reality, even if in the real world some bias may be viewed as incorrect
11/03/25, 11:52 am - Barveen Kumar: People who love maverick 🤜🤛 People who love conformists

Ecosystem will always try to balance itself (most of the time) 😅
11/03/25, 11:53 am - Barveen Kumar: I think to reflect the reality properly then it has to become a sentient
11/03/25, 11:53 am - Barveen Kumar: <Media omitted>
11/03/25, 11:54 am - Mahesh *CFC: Nah….

Just take facts and tell them as they are…

I tried asking for crime statistics couple of years back to early ChatGPT…

And GOD…it didn’t give it to me AT ALLLLL saying it is not politically correct or something. <This message was edited>
11/03/25, 11:55 am - Barveen Kumar: Have you tried Perplexity's reasoning mode?
11/03/25, 11:55 am - Mahesh *CFC: negative
11/03/25, 11:55 am - Barveen Kumar: Give it a try. Might find it useful.
11/03/25, 11:56 am - Mahesh *CFC: *yeah will do <This message was edited>
11/03/25, 11:56 am - Barveen Kumar: Before that, use claude or ChatGPT to generate/engineer a prompt and feed them on Perplexity 😂
11/03/25, 11:58 am - Barveen Kumar: You should read the article that I've shared above!!

When we feed a misinformation over the time, it'll become a fact to LLMs. Cmon, they are child with hunger for knowledge and they are still learning like us.

11/03/25, 12:29 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: Have you used Deep Research mode on ChatGPT? It’s available on Plus plan. And it is good.

Grok’s opinionated approach may look cool, but I’d like to analyze from both angles when it comes to research.

And again, you can design your prompt to make ChatGPT opinionated as well.
11/03/25, 1:04 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I use Deep Research with o1 yes. For sources and research, and then write content based on it. 

But what I want is to slowly start using AI for “content writing” , so that “when” a model that can general content with minimal human-in-loop comes, I know what to do and expect. <This message was edited>
11/03/25, 1:06 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I was successful in making ChatGPT-4 form an opinion and sometimes even write good content, but it absolutely loves to revert back to “safe” in 2-3 messages.

12/03/25, 10:09 am - Rodick: Damn.
12/03/25, 10:12 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: The world will constantly make you doubt yourself. Your idea will look plain, simple, and boring compared to what others have got. That’s exactly when you’re supposed to hold on to it more strongly. Blackberry didn’t die because Apple invented large screens. Blackberry died because they believed too weakly on keyboards. They didn’t stick to their original idea: they got scared, distracted and ran towards the trend. The winning probability of an idea is not metric of how good it is but rather how sticky it is.

12/03/25, 11:50 am - Hameed *CTO, Success: 💯 So true. I have recently read somewhere, “you can’t always make right decisions. You make a decision and then make it right”

It depends on how much you believe in the idea, how confident are you to make it valuable and how deep can you explore.

Got a few cute tools for you content writers (recommended by a marketing agency who’s our fren 🎀)

1. Ojoy.ai
2. ⁠getkong.ai

Tried both these tools out…they put in good effort to replicate my tone. 

Gave me outlines that I converted into first drafts without any trouble. 

Don’t know how good they are with research and source gathering.

Everyday morning 6 am, you will get a challenge to complete, tips to help, and you do it and share it on the Internet for accountability and rating. By the end 100 days, you would have tried bunch of things that I usually try in my own community and mastered by practicing them. Do you guys need this?
14/03/25, 12:07 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: It would be like working with me every single day.
14/03/25, 12:08 pm - +91 77085 78300: Yes
14/03/25, 12:18 pm - Barveen Kumar: Yeah
14/03/25, 12:19 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: Yeah!!

14/03/25, 1:19 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: What would be the focus for 100 days?
14/03/25, 1:19 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I'm in eitherways.
14/03/25, 1:20 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Community
14/03/25, 1:21 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: Deepak bro operates in a different way bro. Kettaalum solla mattaaru. 😃
14/03/25, 1:22 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Theriyum 

But I have said yes to wayy to many things and then been like "oh fuck, I am spread too thin"
14/03/25, 1:22 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: <Media omitted>
14/03/25, 1:24 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Yup. This movie was a big reason for that. 

Saying yes to everything did open alot of doors for me...

But not all of those lead me to where I truly wanted to go.
14/03/25, 1:24 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: So this year, I am being intentional. Sat down, made a vision board, and I am using that as my true north.
14/03/25, 1:25 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Anything that's not taking me where I want to go, I'm respectfully declining.
14/03/25, 1:25 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: That’s great!
14/03/25, 1:26 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: "We can do anything we want. But not everything we want" 

I think you quoted this to me right @919884677563?
14/03/25, 1:27 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Just curious. How many of yall have vision boards?
14/03/25, 1:27 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: Yeah.

14/03/25, 3:08 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: A community should first benefit you (host). Community is not charity born out of interest to give others. Don’t confuse both. @917550239842
14/03/25, 3:09 pm - +91 75502 39842: Yess nalla insight atha understand pandra mindset ipodhiku illa anna, focusing on building myself and things i love to eventually form a like minded people together
14/03/25, 3:37 pm - +91 97910 22282: Annen me..
14/03/25, 5:33 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: 15 days of emails written, completed. 85 to go! This is damn hardwork but I’m myself re-learning so much. This is seriously gold if you sign up. Miss at your own peril.
14/03/25, 5:55 pm - +91 86789 15148: How to sign up
14/03/25, 5:55 pm - +91 86789 15148: Or is it coming with the bonfire email, we already signed up

Started my first day @917397390737 

A community for all the Fashionpreneur was always there in mind but never started one. 

Thanks for this challenge which made me start one today !
16/03/25, 5:32 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Awesome!
16/03/25, 5:34 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Nice! Helping fashion business owners go from local to global leaders!! But, just to improvise, can we destine what global leaders really mean? Like example: help fashion business owners go from local to 10 abroad franchises / shops. Or 1000 non-Indian customers.
16/03/25, 5:34 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Think about it.
16/03/25, 5:36 pm - Aakash J Fashionprenuer: Kandippa anna !

17/03/25, 12:37 pm - +91 97516 72013: DNA Stone age

This is a 3 days plan.

Where we all stay on an island, and we do all the survival skills chores on our own.

Option 1: We cook food, we make tents, we discuss inventing something that might be needed for the future.

Option 2: We discuss wars, we do some political campaigns on our own, we use our DNA money, and we conduct elections.

Or we could mingle this both.
17/03/25, 12:37 pm - +91 99860 20096: DNA version of BIG BOSS!
17/03/25, 3:29 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: You guys have thrown some big fancy ideas on the table. Just add to the mix, can we try something longer than 3 days? Like 30 days? Is it even possible? Just thinking loud
17/03/25, 3:45 pm - +91 88388 08443: Undercover billionaire (DNA EDITION)
In this community there are many business owners and startup founders there and you'll have the idea how to build a company or brand.
So the task will be you'll be given a random domain in which you have to build that from scratch without any prior contacts or connection in 30 days.
You have to make some money with that at the end of the 30th day and DNA will have certain shares from that. <This message was edited>
17/03/25, 4:14 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I have an idea. Just idea. React if you like it. We rent an Airbnb for 30 days. 10 of us. We build, ship and market — one time thing. Not all products need support or updates. Some just run: back me here @918447545891 @919884150664. We pick the right idea, micro one. We split the revenue for life. No meetings. No long term commitment. Just passive revenue. What do you all think?
17/03/25, 4:18 pm - +91 91766 77747: Wow
17/03/25, 4:23 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Did I go overboard?

17/03/25, 4:25 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: No, you are thinking bold, as usual!

17/03/25, 4:33 pm - Rodick: DNA  Aatam Paatam Kondattam 

A dance competition / party 🕺  of DNA Members
17/03/25, 4:36 pm - +91 84475 45891: Haha yea bold idea.. happy to explore.. but it’s hard to find a truly passive idea..
17/03/25, 4:37 pm - Rodick: Does it have to be SaaS  or digital alone ? Can it be building an entire full fledged startup , doing the backend , like market research,  business analysis,  etc <This message was edited>
17/03/25, 4:37 pm - +91 84475 45891: We can look at exiting the business once it has stable revenue.. or one/few of us can acquire it and run it
17/03/25, 4:37 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Yeah that’s the idea. Sell it 5-8x ARR and we all walk home happy <This message was edited>
17/03/25, 4:39 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: 10k MRR — 120k ARR — Million Dollar Exit.
17/03/25, 4:40 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: We got distribution, engineering, operations all covered. All sides look safe and covered. Worse case? We walk back with a documentary movie @919629392810
17/03/25, 4:41 pm - Enchipsu: <Media omitted>
17/03/25, 4:44 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Instead inventing anything new, we can build something that already exists. @918447545891 a well validated idea that just needs execution.
17/03/25, 5:06 pm - +91 84475 45891: Yea probably a version of something that’s already working

17/03/25, 5:19 pm - Rodick: Mass.
17/03/25, 5:33 pm - +91 98841 50664: Love the idea, I know it’ll work for sure. I wish I wasn’t in a full time job so I could do this
17/03/25, 6:41 pm - Mahesh *CFC: An idea 

DNA “ASAP”

DNA Awkward Situation Assistance Program

So a few days ago, I was travelling and went to meet someone and their family over dinner. 

Guy made everything awkward, was disrespectful to his family, yelling and started going on a never ending extremely offensive racist + misogynistic monologue to me because no one else would listen. Not the causal racism or misogyny ….but it was so serious it felt like it was coming from some al Qaeda terrorist. 

(thankfully I was wearing wearing sunglasses thanks to my sensory probs so I just zoned out and thought about what content to write next)

But, it wasted like 4 hours of my time and stressed me so bad that I couldn’t go to sleep. 

At that moment, I was praying a client or prospect or SOMEONE would call me, and I can use it to say I have a call to take and leave.  

Here’s my idea - have a kutty app with a big red button. 

When a DNA member presses that button, all other DNA members get a notification telling that “<name> is caught up in an awkward situation, call and recover” <This message was edited>

17/03/25, 6:52 pm - Mahesh *CFC: It gave me something that feels like an app. 

What’s the next step?

Host it and make it a web app?
17/03/25, 6:52 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Yeah.
17/03/25, 6:53 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Idea is how quickly things can go from idea to execution

17/03/25, 6:56 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah. Any awkward situation where getting a call is an easy way out.
17/03/25, 6:56 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: It should give me a fake call UI. I should attend, and then until I press cut it should stay active
17/03/25, 6:56 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I’ve hit the button. Try now please.
17/03/25, 6:56 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: What the heck

17/03/25, 6:57 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Is this for the instance I hit the button?
17/03/25, 6:57 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: It should ask me. 

Fake call, or alert a friend to actually call.
17/03/25, 6:58 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Okay. This is my pet project now.

Time to wake up my modding GitHub account

17/03/25, 7:08 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: 10 minutes
17/03/25, 7:09 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Tech bros

To polish the ASAP button tool and make it send a “push notification” to the members who have signed up,

Would taking my current version code (all of it) from GitHub sending it to Open AI o3-mini and asking it to add that feature above work? <This message was edited>

19/03/25, 8:57 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: If you want to check if people want a community, then ask do they want to be together, not do they want a consultation call. You’re asking the wrong question to collect the right answer. This is my thought.
19/03/25, 9:10 am - +91 90944 04174: Hmm 🤔 understood bro, I thought while taking the consultation call I will ask then personally. But I think I should I added a line. Thanks for the suggestion

Content has been still the king/queen of marketing. And, distribution boosts the play on a game.

On our days ahead DISTRIBTION via COMMUNITY is gonna be a huge opportunity I believe.

And, in that case we at DNA are on the right path 🤝❤️

20/03/25, 8:59 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Watched Mouna Raagam Movie yesterday. Re-watched I should say after decades. What a movie ra. Hooks you from start to end. Such a simple storyline. But itha 2.5 hours hook panikaru Mani sir. And then today we have movies like Vidamuyarchi trying too hard, adding all unnecessary nonsense to keep the audience engaged eventually fails. Do watch re watch the movie again. <This message was edited>
20/03/25, 9:00 am - +91 77083 31133: Yes exactly bro. There is no storyline nowadays and only kuthu song with no meanings and waste screenplay. Many movies are there bro like this.

20/03/25, 9:15 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: I’ll tell you the reason why I think we should do this. Then you folks help me decide whether to move forward or not.   By simply replacing reels time with classic art, movies, paintings, podcasts, Documentary we can become a better creator. It is what we consume, we become. These classic we might have seen when were too young to understand the brilliance and artistic side of things. We must have just clapped for scenes, stories and song. Now, we can see more into them. And that would stimulate different side of our brains, fire our neurons. That’s the goal. We will watch great movies, explore about great artists, watch their documentaries, or audio listen to books. Every weekend. Instead of just Gmeet.

20/03/25, 10:05 am - Mahesh *CFC: Ladies and gentlemen 

This, 

This. 

This guy is one of those “startup bros” who were sold on the “AI can do anything and everything and I don’t want to hire anyone and I’ll do everything myself. Let me layoff people and tell everyone how ChatGPT is better”

This is also why I hate the “experts” in these big networking panel discussions who just vomit “AI is the future we are now building things 100% with AI” 

And here, I saw that a combination of disasters happened 

- AI just gave the code. A bulk of it. But the thing is, it doesn’t know how humans operate
- ⁠The endpoint of API & secret keys were in public.   
- ⁠The ENTIRE database connection string were exposed in the homepage 

Now, AI did the bulk of the code. No problems. But these bugs, errors and edge cases are why you hire developers and testing people.

SSR said this to me once too - “you’ll have AI doing the heavy lifting, and people with extremely good domain knowledge will be responsible in giving their inputs to get the best output” <This message was edited>

Ever since 2021,  when i was a junior agricultural researcher studying online , I've noticed several market gaps in Controlled Environment Agriculture,  and this one bridges them perfectly.  Will talk more about it in the coming days, and brainstorm from your opinions as well :) <This message was edited>

As some of you know, I’ve been working with a few college students, and we’re together building a community for undergrad college students - adhu thaan namma “Think Digital Students Community”.

The community is looking for a indoor space in Chennai that can occupy upto 25 people for a community gathering this Sunday, to casually gather, connect and brainstorm.

Namma pasanga usually kind & growth minded students thaan. They’re also exposed to a few office spaces before; adhunaala avangalukku oru basics of how to utilize the space in a right way nu idea irukkum; and they’re self-governing too. 

So, Nambi kudukkalaam. I can guarantee that there’ll not be any issues/troubles created in and around the space.

This Sunday, from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM max.

Unga office space share panna mudiyum ah? Mikka Nandrigal ✨
25/03/25, 10:44 am - +91 97910 22282: Upto 15 my office can hold
25/03/25, 10:45 am - +91 97910 22282: What activity is planned for those 6 hours?

To look for other options
25/03/25, 10:53 am - GS Thina DNA: Vanakkam na.

There’s usually discussions around their progress of the last month in their community roadmaps, casual fun conversations. Avlothaan.

We also prefer sitting on the floor if that’s possible. So, empty spaces are mostly preferred.

This will not be an event setup, No special guests, no mic/speakers required.

Vanakam DNA Kudumbam,

I’ve been refining the idea of a stock market for content creators for a while now, and it’s time to go all in. 

I’m building a team and looking for *one finance person* and *one tech person* to join me.

I’m only looking for two things: some practical experience and genuine passion for the field.

More details are in the application form. 

If you know someone who has completed college and is available for a full-time role in a fast-paced startup, please refer them!
25/03/25, 12:18 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Nice carousel Harish. You have speak more about idea. Find more ways to talk about it. Same story, different screenplay.

Some of you know me from DNA. Others from Scrollme. A few from Habitate. Maybe you took my course. Read my book. Some know me as a community builder. Others as a founder.

But who am I, really?

I’ve been here for 32 years, 5 months, and 16 days.

And in that time, here’s what I’ve done.
25/03/25, 12:24 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: That’s all my entire life. Filled in one A4 paper.
25/03/25, 12:25 pm - +91 75502 39842: Well illustrated naa
25/03/25, 12:29 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: It was a good exercise to do this. I recommend you all to do it too. Fill a A4 with your life so far. Some really nice images and moments flashed as I wrote this. Feels good.

29/03/25, 1:43 am - Rodick: The movie was amazing . The conversations that followed,  even better.

29/03/25, 9:54 am - Mahesh *CFC: Why do I disagree HARDDDDD with this post?
29/03/25, 9:55 am - +91 82485 54880: You're dealing with B2B right ?!
29/03/25, 9:56 am - Saran Alagarswamy: We work with B2c it is still rewarding ..
29/03/25, 9:57 am - Mahesh *CFC: A lot of times, I feel that AI takes things too seriously. 

I told it to be raw and brutal in terms of content improvements. 

So it then proceeds to insult the reader 🤦🏻‍♂️

This is a marketing article for AI agency owners, and the bot’s recommendation is to insult their agency in the first line. 

There must be a sweet spot and I’m working on finding it.
29/03/25, 9:57 am - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah but that post makes zero sense brother
29/03/25, 9:58 am - Mahesh *CFC: I mean…the top 2 F500 companies are B2C
29/03/25, 9:58 am - +91 82485 54880: Yeahh....

I remember Mr.Arun from Guvi gave an insight about B2B & B2C during our DNA school event....


He said there is fire-fighting in terms of B2C .....

He's giving skills coaching to college students....

I couldn't fully understand what he was trying to convey by saying fire-fighting.... <This message was edited>
29/03/25, 11:26 am - +91 91766 77747: Interesting
29/03/25, 11:27 am - +91 97910 22282: It's not black and white like this.

It varies and it depends on many aspects .
29/03/25, 11:29 am - +91 91766 77747: True that
29/03/25, 1:36 pm - Rodick: Is Chat GPT  screwing up for everyone or is it just me?
29/03/25, 1:38 pm - Ar.Sameer: It's doing good. It started free image generation if you're interested..
29/03/25, 1:38 pm - +91 75502 39842: Unfortunately or fortunately it is (mainly for tech industry)
29/03/25, 1:39 pm - +91 75502 39842: High margins usually and high profits mainly in tech , saas , service like dev, security or cloud
29/03/25, 1:40 pm - +91 75502 39842: But minimum workforce employees
29/03/25, 1:45 pm - +91 82485 54880: How about Education industry !?
29/03/25, 1:50 pm - +91 75502 39842: Honestly..

29/03/25, 9:54 pm - +91 75502 39842: how to increase my pricing?
29/03/25, 9:54 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Go ahead
29/03/25, 9:55 pm - +91 75502 39842: have been working with a client for almost 2 years, agreement expires by 31st, we are considering to increase the price obviously, and they are fine with that tho, but i don't wanna loose them too hehe
29/03/25, 9:55 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Attend Revenueholic deep dive calls. 

Jk (but that’s true tho) 

Let’s start with this question. 

What prompted you with increasing your rates? <This message was edited>
29/03/25, 9:55 pm - +91 75502 39842: planning to add a few more services
29/03/25, 9:57 pm - +91 75502 39842: hehe yes sure, but 2023, i proposed them with let's $500, they were like we don't know you, but wanna work tho, let's do at 200, i was like yeah ok makes sense, 

it's 2025, it's obvious to increase the price, having said that they are satisfied with my works, but i feel i need a lil more money to offer extra services and increase the scope of work and give more values and freebies too
29/03/25, 10:08 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Would be a good sales example to cover. Stay tuned. Will post on LinkedIn about this tomorrow
29/03/25, 10:09 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Need to put some thought into this.

30/03/25, 7:22 pm - Mahesh *CFC: FOR FUCKS SAKE. 

Lonkedin has to save drafts.
30/03/25, 7:22 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Was cooking up THE BEST sales example for the upselling question
30/03/25, 7:23 pm - Mahesh *CFC: And this stupid mac triggered some stupid key combo and then took me to some random page
30/03/25, 7:23 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I come back and the draft is GONE
30/03/25, 7:23 pm - Mahesh *CFC: POOF
30/03/25, 7:23 pm - Mahesh *CFC: POOF
30/03/25, 7:24 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Every single day. That place makes me angrier
30/03/25, 7:24 pm - Mahesh *CFC: And then the page reloads. 

And the FIRST thing I see is random engagement farmer selling some stupid “imagine you’re a marketing expert” prompt
30/03/25, 7:26 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I’ll just do it again tonight after I punch all my frustration away at the gym 

Lesson learnt - write in google doc and paste it on LinkedIn.
30/03/25, 7:27 pm - +91 86789 15148: That's my advice too or else use chrome extensions like cleo
30/03/25, 7:29 pm - Mahesh *CFC: LinkedIn now to me is what ChatGPT was 7 months back. 

EVERY TIME I try to do something meaningful, something or the other throws everything outta the window.
30/03/25, 7:32 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Sorry man @917550239842 I’ve failed you. But the post is still coming
30/03/25, 7:34 pm - Rodick: Lol thats exactly what I do
30/03/25, 7:35 pm - Rodick: Faced the same  a few months ago . I have something called the content calendar in notes where I write a date and write content accordingly . Then copy paste it
30/03/25, 7:41 pm - Mahesh *CFC: My writing process for all my other posts usually involve me repurposing content or typing a “tweet” sorta post from my phone.
30/03/25, 7:59 pm - Ar.Sameer: I just WhatsApp to myself. 

It gets saved as a draft and we can edit from there on.

Formatting is accurate too.

Scary times ahead, but glad we're at the forefront
31/03/25, 5:07 pm - Mahesh *CFC: The forefront is neurodivergent people ruling out all edge cases in AI now using pattern recognition and working with ULTRA-specific tools using their knowledge and experience <This message was edited>
31/03/25, 5:08 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Having experience with video games helps me a TON in trying to tame AI
31/03/25, 5:08 pm - Barveen Kumar: Yeah!!! And, its straight on the point. We are at the point where our mind has been struck to some extend. Like 'Why reinvent the wheel?," where I'm screaming to the self on "Why did people even thought about inventing the wheel in the first place?"

So that's the end game?

Are we sure?

Guys, we are struck and decelerating slow on the lane of evolution. We've been thinking that we are advancing further, but by not reinventing the wheel? It'll make us end up struck within the same legion by replacing a block on a lego then call it a great invention.
31/03/25, 5:21 pm - Barveen Kumar: Not all edge cases @918778045446. I can name lot of them, but here are some: risk management, cultural preservation, mapping, global scarcity(food, shelter, health) and it can be attained only when we develop a program that works by asking "Why?" not "what" has been fed to them.

We are glorifying a pattern recog mechanism that is fast, near to accurate than most of the human. We've coined the term correctly "ARTIFICIAL 'INTELLIGENCE'"

But an intelligence should have various elements combined together to work in harmony - Perception, Sensory(tech can see some stuff now),memory, knowledge, reasoning, logic, creativity, innovation, self aware, meta cognition are major stuff.

When a program attains all these, then i'm so sure that it'll become a sentient 😅

I tried the latest video model from Runway. 

The competition among these image and video generators are heating up and coming up with some impressive updates. 

I used a complex image to video and it nailed it.

03/04/25, 2:45 pm - +91 96770 33485: Hello everyone!

Thank you all for the warm welcome! And a special thanks to @918838542051 for your kind words.

I’m the founder of Narchuvai Foods. Before starting this brand, I worked in digital marketing for over four years. However, my true passion lies in entrepreneurship, cooking, and all things traditional.

Coming from a Chettinad background, where food holds great significance and spices and traditional recipes are deeply cherished, I was inspired to venture into the food industry. My focus is on creating traditional food products that align with modern lifestyles, making healthy eating both convenient and authentic.

It has been about one and a half years since I started Narchuvai Foods, and the journey has been fulfilling. However, managing everything on my own made me realize the importance of being part of a like-minded community where we can support and grow together.

Looking forward to this new beginning with all of you!😇☺️
03/04/25, 2:45 pm - Ar.Sameer: Adhu kandipaa illa bro. 

I use these extensively and I have a research process behind it. 

I think what @919986020096 asked for was illustrations and not infographics.


And it's great with style! 

Hence the suggestion.
03/04/25, 2:49 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Yesss. I'm using it every to FAFO one thing at a time.

03/04/25, 3:03 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I think the biggest breakthrough is ChatGTP finally renders hands with 5 fingers like a human being
03/04/25, 3:03 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Which means now you “CAN” generate humans yourself without relying on people who sell AI model designs.
03/04/25, 3:05 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Still. 

Still. 

Do not do this in marketing creatives. 

People buy from REAL PEOPLE. 

AI generated humans might look realistic but in our brains, it triggers the “uncanny valley” reflex, 

which is the same stress response you get when ancient humans saw dead rotting corpses…

Or worses

Neanderthals (human-like, but not actually human) who would pillage and raid human caves

03/04/25, 3:10 pm - Mahesh *CFC: This is primarily for uninformed people who think they can simply say 

“I can use AI models from now for marketing. Don’t need actors, video editors, scriptwriters, etc”
03/04/25, 3:12 pm - +91 75502 39842: I'm hating ishan sharma for promoting vibe coding and such stuff
03/04/25, 3:12 pm - Mahesh *CFC: If anyone would like to disagree…

I’ll send you a picture that researchers used to identify this reflex.

03/04/25, 10:25 pm - +91 97910 22282: Sometimes I envy Deepak . (Always) such a great human he is. 

Suspense irukatum. He did something today that even I dint think about for myself or my family. 

If you are in this group and reading this - trust me when I say this.. You are in one of the bestest community that can exist .
03/04/25, 10:28 pm - +91 97910 22282: The guys brain thinks for all every moment. 

I have a quote for myself called *think for all*..

I miss that thought many times..

But Deepak is like.. 24/7 think for all.

Truly happy to know him and be Here part of DNA. 

And to add spice, I always thought I was the best community man cause I built a community for Architects with 10k memebrs. Our own Sameer is also from our community.

But before Deepak s work, I really feel little and his work pushes me to do more. 

Inspiring stuff he does.
03/04/25, 10:30 pm - +91 97910 22282: Why this message?

He sent me one whatsapp msg asking for something so bloody Simple but so effective.. 

And he genuinely asked to make me happy 

I ve seen many folks in my life who have been selfless..

But our D is the OG.

04/04/25, 12:28 pm - Rodick: The Studio Ghibli-style images are everywhere! 

And I think it's cute and delightful!

The soft colors, the dreamlike feel… it’s like turning everyday moments into something magical. 

Little pockets of joy sprinkled across our feeds.

But then, the numbers.
Almost everyone's talking about how harmful this is to the environment...

1 image = 0.08 kg CO2 emissions.
1 billion people generate these kinds of images every day.
1 day emissions= 80,000,000 kg CO2 every day.

Of course, plenty of industries have worse emissions. 

But seeing these numbers makes you pause. It’s the kind of truth that sits uncomfortably. 

The joy is real, but so is the impact.

And so, we sit with both -  the delight of something beautiful and the weight of knowing what it takes to create it.

And thats why climate change is a grey area.

What regulators can do is..
04/04/25, 12:32 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Make it mandatory to offset the carbon footprint.
04/04/25, 12:33 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: https://krystal.io/green Like how this company does.

04/04/25, 12:39 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I did a project a few years ago, as part of training an intern team. A kgCO2 calculator based, and then if the company chooses to offset, we give them a web-banner (like the DMCA one) and then forward the request to a Rotract club. They'll do the plantation of Bamboo trees (which produce more oxygen). We had the prototype. Just didn't have the resources to pull it off.

Midjourney becomes conversational. You can talk your prompts to it.

04/04/25, 9:27 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: @918447545891
04/04/25, 9:50 pm - +91 84475 45891: Haha lots of philosophy in this.. but essentially we have the most fun when we play games just for the sake of playing them, not to win or compete.. 
that’s how we were as kids.. that’s why anything we did was pure fun.. no agenda, no stress.. 
then society taught us to compete and killed the fun out of every activity.. then we started setting goals around marks, money, status, power etc. 
I can read a thousand page book and learn from it just for pure fun, and enjoy the subject.. but if I’m forced to write an exam around it and pressured to score marks and get the top rank then I’ll start hating that subject.. 
a life riddled with goals is joyless.. 
(Just my humble opinion 🙏)
04/04/25, 10:41 pm - +91 82485 54880: You're 100% right !!

06/04/25, 2:51 am - +91 97910 22282: Seat Belt, (even in rear seat),

Helmet , even if you are going to the next street at 10km / hour speed..  

Rear seat, slow, I know, I am a good driver, I am very safe,..

Nothing is a good reason.

Just wear that damn helmet.

And wrap that seat belt.. 

Anubavathula solren..

F**k  that over confidence...

When you drive.. seat belt and helmet are a must.. 

When one life goes.. many lives never begin...

Take care, and do it for tihers..  it's not a cricket match or social media post to experiment..  

Helmet when I bike,
Seat belt when in car..

Must..
06/04/25, 2:52 am - +91 97910 22282: *When one life goes, many lives never begin.*

06/04/25, 11:04 am - Ar.Sameer: I wear my helmet even if I have to go to my nearby grocery store. 

This has been the case for very long time. 

It feels sticky, messes my hair. But I just do it. 

Some ask "inga irukka kadaiki helmet aa"

I ignored them for a while and they stopped asking. 

THIS. IS. IMPORTANT
06/04/25, 11:04 am - Mahesh *CFC: All the best @919543218330
06/04/25, 11:05 am - Meenank Minnu: Wow, @919543218330 will crush it for sure
06/04/25, 11:05 am - Meenank Minnu: just that he’s way too humble XD
06/04/25, 11:06 am - Meenank Minnu: I like him, in the interaction I had with him. He’s a patient listener, which will make him succeed for sure. 
 what workshop is he doing?
06/04/25, 11:06 am - Mahesh *CFC: I completely agree with you and @919791022282 here. 

People (even my parents) would make fun. My rule is - if I'm taking my motorcycle out of the driveway, helmet goes on. Even if it's just to go to my nearby gym / store / gas station. 

If I’ll drive over 40 Kmph I'll wear gloves and jeans. No exceptions. People used to make fun of me whilst I did this during kalej, but I had 3 times where gearing up saved me from road rashes and injuries.
06/04/25, 11:07 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: And the best part is @919791022282 has provided the office to do it! It’s all happening within DNA! Proud and happy.

06/04/25, 11:11 am - Meenank Minnu: Venu Kalyan has already set the playbook
06/04/25, 11:11 am - Mahesh *CFC: If you ever been in my car, you also would’ve noticed that I’d drive as slow & smooth as possible. Again, I’ve avoided so many near misses and potential accidents because of this one thing.

In motorsports (both real life racing and sim racing alike), we have a saying 

Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. 

I also give out a LOT of space between me and vehicles in front. 

It’s again a hack where I get ungodly amounts of fuel economy because I never touch my brakes except to come to a full stop, 

and it’s also a rule in motorsports, 

where if you’re far away from traffic, you’re not “in traffic”. You are in your own zone and you’re free to move as you prefer. <This message was edited>
06/04/25, 11:11 am - Meenank Minnu: All @919543218330 has to do is to follow this playbook and damn, he's gonna print money, become famous and skyrocket
06/04/25, 11:12 am - Meenank Minnu: wow, I sent the msg at 11:11 too.
06/04/25, 11:13 am - +91 97516 72013: All the best bro @919543218330
06/04/25, 11:13 am - Mahesh *CFC: Unlike what most normies think, driving skill is not going kamikaze in highways and passing trucks dangerously close and high speeds. 

Real skill is when you can get from point A to point B with the least amount of acceleration and turning, and when you have full grip on the wheels at all points of your drive. <This message was edited>
06/04/25, 11:40 am - Rodick: Yes. I agree.

09/04/25, 3:07 pm - +91 86789 15148: 8th day of #100daysofcommunity

Today's challenge:

Pick a day that feels right.

Give it a name. Make it memorable.

Something Your Community Looks Forward To.

Immediately thought ...

What if mamakologi.id has a weekly program with a pantry homey nuance?

Because for me, mamakology.id is a home.

...

Where mothers can grow, feel enough, and don't need to pretend strong.

I started to imagine:

Every day you have your own vibe.

Have your own aroma.

Have a topic that can make mothers feel at home chatting and sharing each other in the community group

And I brewed this:

"Weekly Program Mamakology.id"

Monday - Tea (Find Life Energy)

Starting the beginning of the week with a discussion about self-loves, mental health, and personal growth.

Tuesday Coffee (Mother Application Collection)

14/04/25, 12:24 pm - Ar.Sameer: I have a friend.

He's an Artist.. He is great at movies, making them, decoding them..

Great at painting..

He's an amazing musician..

He would make music just for me!!! He'll put me in a situation and creat this amazing jingles..

The problem with him is he does what he does at the time he like for the money he doesn't want. 

I'm unable to put him in any good collaboration for that sake.

But this music will make your day....I'm the hero in it. (Too proud to say that) 

❤️

14/04/25, 12:30 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Ask him to upload on a site, and give it for users to download them for free. Put a button that says, create custom music for $x.
14/04/25, 12:30 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: Sounds amazing!
14/04/25, 12:31 pm - Ar.Sameer: Great idea! Should ask him to do tha or volunteer myself to set it up for him. Thanks bro ❤️

14/04/25, 12:51 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Yesterday, I felt like an ageing sportsman being questioned by fresh blood.
14/04/25, 12:52 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I had a long conversation for about an hour with a young founder. He asked me the kind of questions that make you stop and think. “Why do you do the things you do? What’s the purpose behind it all? Where’s the agenda?” He looked at me and said, “Deepak, I see you doing so many good things, but you aren’t niching down on one thing. If DNA School was successful, why didn’t you do it again? Why the DNA Village? Are you just distracted by new ideas?”
14/04/25, 12:53 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: At that moment, I didn’t know how to answer. The questions stung a bit. It wasn’t like I had a scripted reply to those tough, yet genuine, reflections. And I found myself wondering: Am I setting up the wrong example? Am I outdated? I’ve been on this path for a while now—creating, experimenting, and innovating—but hearing that made me question if I was missing something. Maybe I wasn't living by the advice I give to others. Maybe I’d lost the ambition. The spirit.
14/04/25, 12:55 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: After the call, I was left blank, sad even. Is this who I’ve become? Maybe this fresh new energy was starting to expose cracks I hadn’t noticed before. It hit me hard.
14/04/25, 12:58 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I found the answer, my wife reminded me of it. When I came back home, I sat with my wife and shared everything. I needed to talk it out. After a long pause, she simply said, “You don’t like playing it safe.”  In a world obsessed with sticking to a formula, I refuse to play by the rules. I break them. I’m not stagnant. I’m alive.
14/04/25, 12:59 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I am not outdated. I’m setting the pace for those who come after me.
14/04/25, 1:02 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Moral of the story is
14/04/25, 1:02 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Don’t let someone else’s version of success make you doubt your own path. Trust in your strengths.
14/04/25, 1:07 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Creators must be dynamic, testing new ideas and not sticking to one thing. That's what I think. Everything will fall into place one day. Until then, keep building, creating, and making connections. The best is yet to come.
14/04/25, 6:44 pm - +91 72000 62218: Much needed!🥹
15/04/25, 10:29 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Hey DNA folks, some of you here I think uses Scrollme today. I got news to share with you. We are closing the doors, shutting it down. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/deepak910k_today-we-shut-down-scrollme-a-product-activity-7317773239215173632-SiXA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABxItMABrvlvxLLH-dMSHqUwCFc-zJyDUDQ

15/04/25, 10:33 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Reason is mentioned in the post. Companies are taking away the APIs. Internet is no longer open as it was.

Is there anything I can do for DNA there?". I had to pause and think for a second. I didn't expect. But it is things like these, that gives me faith in building this community. We care for each other. Always. Thanks Hameed.

16/04/25, 8:55 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Hey DNA folks, Happy to tell you that we have figured out what to do next. It's an interesting project, not because it's fancy, but I think it's going to change lives of the people. That's exactly what DNA has been doing again and again. Allow me to introduce, The DNA Weekend School.

16/04/25, 9:22 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Hey, I know many of you are already part of the group.
And maybe that’s exactly why you haven’t commented.

But hear me out—
It’s when we start taking things for granted…
that things slowly start falling apart.

So don’t sit back just because you’re “already in.”
Act like it’s your first time.
Comment like you still want to be in.
Like you're re-earning your spot.

Because in great communities, there are no permanent members.
Only those who continue to show up.

Let’s go. One comment. That’s all it takes.
16/04/25, 10:03 am - +91 82485 54880: Posted comment as soon as I saw the post ✌🏻
16/04/25, 10:03 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Good boy! ❤️
16/04/25, 2:57 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: Definitely 💯👍
16/04/25, 3:15 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I have spoken 15 people since morning about this DNA Weekend School. Didn't eat. Didn't bath. I'm feeling the low sugar right now, hands are trembling. That blood rush! It's so beautiful to have it, the dopamine of creating something. I know from my personal experience, until this gets done, it's going to be this way. New toy to the kid. This time I'm going to focus a little bit on affordability. Our DNA events been expensive keeping a bunch of folks deprived of the value we provide. That's going to be taken care this time. We have onboard 4 venue partners, that's going to bring our cost down, good news. Logging everything with you guys. well you are my fam. aren't you?
16/04/25, 3:16 pm - +91 94429 30787: Yes yes!

16/04/25, 8:07 pm - Hameed *CTO, Success: Meaning of Moat.
16/04/25, 8:11 pm - +91 90944 04174: Perfect
16/04/25, 8:11 pm - +91 90944 04174: "moat" refers to a sustainable competitive advantage that protects a company's market share and profitability. 

It's a metaphor, similar to a physical moat protecting a castle, representing barriers that make it difficult for competitors to enter or challenge a company's position
16/04/25, 8:31 pm - +91 77085 78300: Great
16/04/25, 8:31 pm - +91 77085 78300: Got it

17/04/25, 8:11 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: It's exciting but also hectic, doing multiple things. But I want to make this happen, improve the delivery time. Found a much faster printing partner, that's win. But my shipping is still damn slow. Hopefully this changes that.
17/04/25, 8:19 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Just curious. How do you ship bro?
17/04/25, 8:20 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Right now, or the plans with Amazon?
17/04/25, 8:21 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Amazon I have an idea. Curious about now
17/04/25, 8:21 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Right now, I pack and ship them myself via India post. Sometimes, good souls around me help.
17/04/25, 8:21 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: That’s why it’s extremely slow
17/04/25, 8:30 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Okay makes sense. Have you tried Shiprocket?
17/04/25, 8:30 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: <Media omitted>

17/04/25, 8:33 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Will check out
17/04/25, 8:33 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Aaaand, I am pivoting icrewsystems to an automation + agentic AI workflow space in US and CA region. 

Would be my pleasure to help solve this for you
17/04/25, 8:42 pm - +91 94429 30787: We need to print and paste the label over the packaging after booking! Shiprocket works if we have a small printer handy! 

If not, for Tamilnadu, Professional Couriers are best! They do next day delivery! 

For North India, Speedpost (affordable), or DTDC, DELHIVERY(fast delivery)
17/04/25, 8:43 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: It’s international shipping that’s costing me a lot. Last one, u paid 800 just shipping charges.
17/04/25, 8:43 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: *I
17/04/25, 8:44 pm - +91 94429 30787: Oh! Sorry I don’t have experience in it :)
17/04/25, 8:45 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: If done manually, how much is it costing bro?
17/04/25, 8:46 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Manually, 800, I shipped it to Australia
17/04/25, 8:46 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: <Media omitted>
17/04/25, 8:46 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Canada costed about 400
17/04/25, 8:46 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: EU much costlier
17/04/25, 8:46 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: What if I told you, printing can also be automated 😎
17/04/25, 8:47 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Amazon is making this easy, but im going to lose a cut from the sales
17/04/25, 8:47 pm - +91 94429 30787: Curious!
17/04/25, 8:47 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: We'll connect on a quick call? 

If I can solve it, while keeping the cost intact, I get to put your testimonial on my brochure. Deal?
17/04/25, 8:47 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Printer um vaangi kuduthruveengala.. just kidding
17/04/25, 8:47 pm - +91 94429 30787: Haha
17/04/25, 8:47 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: API call
17/04/25, 8:48 pm - +91 94429 30787: Can I also join the call?
17/04/25, 8:49 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Adra sakka. 
Yes! Google meet then. I'll do a capability demonstration
17/04/25, 8:49 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Leo sir 

Can you build an automation that can help me place automatic orders for White Monster Ultra energy drinks on Zepto
17/04/25, 8:49 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: BTW, this what I'm going to do in Dubai. 

So it'll be a practice run for me
17/04/25, 8:49 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Yes! As long as your browser is open.
17/04/25, 8:49 pm - +91 94429 30787: Super then! I m in
17/04/25, 8:50 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Sure
17/04/25, 8:50 pm - Mahesh *CFC: My coffee machine broke today. Phone died. 

I couldn’t get caffeine nor my daily brainrot for a few minutes. 

Horrible. <This message was edited>
17/04/25, 8:50 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: ~2 problem statements~
2 Users & Testimonials ✅
17/04/25, 8:51 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: BTW. No charge for DNA.
17/04/25, 8:51 pm - +91 94429 30787: That’s a sad thing, man!
17/04/25, 8:52 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah. Current one I have is a cheap Chinese toaster. 

I’m planning to get one hand made in Italy and shipped here.
17/04/25, 8:53 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: You have a coffee machine at home?
17/04/25, 8:53 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah.
17/04/25, 8:54 pm - Mahesh *CFC: <Media omitted>
17/04/25, 8:56 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I just reached home. Booting up the laptop now!
17/04/25, 8:58 pm - Mahesh *CFC: If you guys are interested, we can have DNA Cafe 2.0 one day at this cafe called Vinyl and Brew at Alwarpet

They let you brew your own coffee and also teach you how to do (been to a workshop once)

17/04/25, 10:36 pm - Mahesh *CFC: That pure joy ✨✨✨ 

@918123220297 can understand 😂

18/04/25, 12:21 am - +91 72000 62218: Lessss gooooo! Waiting
18/04/25, 12:21 am - Mahesh *CFC: We’re also moving into “actual” streaming for our live calls instead of having a gmeet which makes me fight with Google every single time I want to record stuff
18/04/25, 10:21 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Good morning, end of the week!
18/04/25, 10:21 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Weekend is hours aways.
18/04/25, 10:21 am - Mahesh *CFC: Weekend is for Mr.Producer to produce content to blast
18/04/25, 6:02 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Picking up the conversation from yesterday @917397390737 @919442930787 @918778045446

18/04/25, 6:13 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: This is a WIP!
18/04/25, 6:15 pm - +91 77085 78300: Wow
18/04/25, 6:16 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: Wow, n8n ah !!
18/04/25, 6:18 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: so since Zepto does not have an official API to work with, there are 2 ways to do this. Create a selenium automation manually that mimics the user input of adding the drink to your cart, and then hitting "Order now"

This will need HIL (human in the loop) because you gotta pay via UPI. No credit / point system available @918778045446 

It becomes a bit "moota poochi kollum naveena machine" 🤣 Just because something can be automated, doesn't mean it should.
18/04/25, 6:19 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I made a detailed video here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U7LauxAgFq8mNYNeLvdevK2NfVyJgEXD/view?usp=sharing 

TL;DW - anything can be automated. This was a simple API call.
18/04/25, 6:21 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: For a client in Banglore, we implemented end-to-end hiring workflow. From CV screening, discovery call (by an AI agent), coding round, till final round scheduling with an actual human. Rough math is: 300 rupees per candidate (based on token Open AI token usage) 

So technically, they'll be able to process 1,00,000+ applications in a day. High demand startups could benefit from this.
18/04/25, 6:25 pm - Rodick: Damn
18/04/25, 6:26 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: If someone has a boring, repetitive task that they're wasting time on, drop a message here or on DM. I'd love to experiment and solve it for you. 

Right now I haven't published this service yet, so early access for DNA. so if I can solve your bottlenecks for you, I expect you to give a testimony on LinkedIn and buy a Chicken Biriyani (non-negotiable) 🤣
18/04/25, 6:26 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Yess! This tool is magic. But expensive xD. 60 Euros a month.
18/04/25, 6:27 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah got it man.
18/04/25, 6:28 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I got an alternative for the broken machine. 

It’s a stovetop Moka Pot for now. 

So for now we’re sorted in the caffeine dept
18/04/25, 6:29 pm - Rodick: Done .
18/04/25, 6:30 pm - Rodick: Consider both done .
18/04/25, 6:30 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Expecting to add "Trusted by Payir Crop" on the landing page very soon!
18/04/25, 6:30 pm - Rodick: Yessir lesgoo
18/04/25, 6:32 pm - +91 94429 30787: Can we populate website orders and WhatsApp orders in google sheet ??
18/04/25, 6:32 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: we can even switch on our room fan with this
18/04/25, 6:32 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: it does amaxing work
18/04/25, 6:34 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Possible. Different types of websites do it in different ways. Webhooks are the easiest, but the hardest I've had to do is to write a script that generates a CSV files and then import it automatically at 6 AM everyday using =IMPORTDATA() on google sheets. 

Whatsapp - possible. I use Macrodroid to capture notifications from phone and trigger a webhook from it.
18/04/25, 6:34 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: aahhh I can finally replace my younger brother
18/04/25, 6:35 pm - +91 94429 30787: Got it Leo!
18/04/25, 6:43 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Once you're ready with the Biriyani, let me know 😂 @919442930787
18/04/25, 6:44 pm - +91 94429 30787: Hehe, you are asking this to a vegetarian! Paneer Biriyani okay?? 🤣
18/04/25, 6:45 pm - +91 91766 77747: The owner is a good friend
18/04/25, 6:49 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Okay 🍻

19/04/25, 10:15 pm - Enchipsu: Anyone up for a badminton game tomorrow morning. Looking for 2 people

20/04/25, 12:14 am - +91 97910 22282: Todays workshop by Deepak was something differnt. 

Thanks Deepak. Learnt so much buddy. 🙏❤️

Theena ku special thanks for orchestrating the workshop.

Rodick and myself alone from DNA attended.

Everyone who could not attend,  you guys missed something really valuable. 

No one teaches like Deepak. 

Semma learning.

Summa sollala.. 4 hours of non stop value from Deepak .

Community Man illa.. he is the community OG!
20/04/25, 12:16 am - +91 97910 22282: Thanks Deepak.

He ensured I registered and attended . He sent his usual msg, "how are you"  last week..

And then he pushed me to register and theena ensured I attended the session today.
20/04/25, 12:18 am - +91 97910 22282: I do take sessions, I mentor people on business, few universities have my workshops content as 2 credit modules.. (I know am flaunting).

But.. 

Deepak s session today was worth gold.. 👌
20/04/25, 12:19 am - +91 97910 22282: After a long time I sat in one place for 4 hours without speaking and I listened to someone who made so much sense.

The man is OG.
20/04/25, 12:19 am - +91 97910 22282: Thanks Deepak, Thanks for all you do buddy.
20/04/25, 12:21 am - +91 97910 22282: We sang a special song for him at the end...


@919543218330   edit panni mass ah release please.. 

And I need the credits for the iniative of singing and making all sing that song..

That was the entire emotion at the end of yhe session <This message was edited>
20/04/25, 12:22 am - +91 97910 22282: And when Deepak does a session all you folks.. don't miss it.. 

Never miss it.

Trust me.. don't miss..

Never seen such an honest mentor / coach / trainer- you can name him however we want.
20/04/25, 12:22 am - +91 97910 22282: Gratitude Deepak! ❤️🙏
20/04/25, 12:23 am - +91 97910 22282: Just went through the notes now.. ..hence the message.
20/04/25, 12:24 am - +91 97910 22282: DNA - all of us are actually not understanding why Deepak does whatever he does and I truly believe we are undervaluing the man's efforts.
20/04/25, 12:24 am - +91 97910 22282: When Deepak calls.. just go
20/04/25, 12:24 am - +91 97910 22282: Bye
20/04/25, 12:27 am - +91 97910 22282: <Media omitted>
20/04/25, 12:28 am - GS Thina DNA: Nandri for initiating this thought na. It felt good.
20/04/25, 12:28 am - +91 97910 22282: He spoke 4.5 hours non stop..  🫂
20/04/25, 12:29 am - +91 97910 22282: And we had to sing this for him
20/04/25, 12:30 am - +91 97910 22282: I literally nudged Theena bro for tea breaks and to close the session at the end
20/04/25, 12:30 am - +91 97910 22282: Deepak is such a pokkisham ❤️🫂

He dint hold back anything..  he just let every trade secret today..
20/04/25, 12:32 am - +91 97910 22282: @917397390737  I just started my second community few minutes back buddy. 

I am so confident now after the session 🙌
20/04/25, 12:59 am - +91 97910 22282: It's OK to play it safe for now... 🫂

And in today's workshop many participants recognised me..

But one participant said that this video was so impactful.

Thanks to @916379005589 and @919600770424 and the entire Townscholar team. 👌 

It was always a team effort
20/04/25, 12:59 am - +91 97910 22282: And do watch this video , it would make so much sense.
20/04/25, 1:02 am - +91 97910 22282: @919094404174  is one fellow who has done really well inspite of limited resources 

There might be more folks at DNA like Him.. 

But I truly admire the kid for what he has done so far. Respect Arunachalam ❤️
20/04/25, 1:03 am - +91 97910 22282: @919952936003 is one more person whom I admire..  grit and sincere to his work
20/04/25, 1:04 am - +91 97910 22282: As I said. There might be more like them but I personally know their stories.. hence the mention . Kindly ignore.
20/04/25, 1:05 am - +91 90944 04174: Nandrigal pala, means a lot bro 🙏✨❤️
20/04/25, 1:05 am - +91 97910 22282: You are such an inspiration da 💛  keep growing and going.

20/04/25, 12:56 pm - +91 97910 22282: Sorry pa
20/04/25, 12:56 pm - +91 77085 78300: No pblm , just kidding
20/04/25, 12:57 pm - +91 97910 22282: Deepak , as i said earlier,  pokkisham! To be treasured.

20/04/25, 1:00 pm - +91 97910 22282: By the way, all 4.5 hours Deepak wore one shades / coolers....

Review of Rebound event please 😊😊🙏🏻🙏🏻
21/04/25, 10:35 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: Good morning DNA! New week, New start.
21/04/25, 11:03 am - +91 90944 04174: Sure once over
21/04/25, 11:04 am - Deepak Kumar DNA: This week, I’m going to make Audio book! Record my book in my own voice. Just booked the studio for Wednesday. Excited about this. It now can be consumed by those who love to listen but not read
21/04/25, 11:08 am - +91 94429 30787: Wow, super na! If you want any female voice in between (as in recreating conversations), do let me know na!
21/04/25, 11:09 am - +91 99860 20096: 💡💡As this week starts, Me and my friend looking to build a "*Creators Community Space*" at Bangalore to start with. It would include more of art space, performance space and for any community and creators. 

We have all the passion to build this space but we are also looking for ideas on revenue generation for the same. I am looking for ideas and solutions from this community. To start with, what would you need/expect in a community space? what are you willing to pay for? <This message was edited>

21/04/25, 6:34 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: https://buttondown.com/theweekendschool/archive/the-one-thing-we-need-to-decide-first/ Second Email from The DNA Weekend School. "The one thing we need to decide first". The one that broke my brain too.
21/04/25, 8:33 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Just had an inbound call. 

Guy wanted to work with me…

but won’t answer a single qualification question directly…

Calls it “too personal” if I ask him about company details like name, address, people in management

Tells me that I’m not allowed to ask about the product / audience / team because it’s a “stealth startup” and I should just trust whatever they’re doing is good and believe in things. 

Wanted to improve sales but got angry when I asked a ballpark figure of revenue and if they have a GTM strategy. 

and wants me to come up with a FULL execution plan for “strategy” AND a quote…

And then gets absolutely pissed and calls me a retard when I ask 

“sure, if you want a quote, do you also have a budget in your mind?” 

Guy said it’s extremely inappropriate to ask if they have a budget, and wants me to go blind and come up with whatever I feel like. 

When I understood some issues and gave suggestions, guy said “this isn’t appropriate and this is not how you do sales calls. You must answer what I ask” 

Had to give him a small lecture on what selling is 

Experienced folks - have you run into people like these? 

Is there a “psychological” reason why people behave like this? <This message was edited>
21/04/25, 9:07 pm - +91 80988 06677: maybe he is shopping for free execution plans or gtm for his stealth startup 😂.

My assumption is these guys will fail sales themselves till they learn some basics
21/04/25, 9:19 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Still, I don’t understand the point of a “stealth startup”

Anyway, their company details are nowhere to be found though they claim they have over 10 employees, 

And I did some preliminary due diligence based on what they spoke in Valar meet up 2 days ago. Failed that too 

And their “secret” app which had a free trial took me to their homepage when I tried to click. <This message was edited>
21/04/25, 9:21 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Guy claimed he does enterprise sales and marketing a lot too, 

but got mad when I asked “is there any bottleneck that’s stopping you from doing it all yourself for your product”? <This message was edited>
21/04/25, 9:22 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: forget it, you could see it's waste of time. why spend more time thinking about it. move on.
21/04/25, 9:23 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: choose peace > educating, correcting people.
21/04/25, 9:23 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Agree.
21/04/25, 9:25 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah. All these sorta make me grateful for the prospects and clients who understand everything.

24/04/25, 10:41 pm - +91 88388 08443: Hello DNA family, hope you are all doing well. Sorry for not being active in the group coz I am somehow struggling to manage my masters so kindly consider my apologies.

So today our community man @917397390737  was randomly checking with me 🥹 like what I am doing...so kind of him right ✨ so after talking with him I had a thought like we are discussing so many stuffs regarding our career, business and entrepreneurship etc... 

What if we do a small random no agenda talk like we used to talk in our breaks in the clg and schools.We used to go to the canteen and share an egg puff with our friends and gossiping about teachers and talking about your crushes 😜 
(Note: I believe in our community @919791022282 @919094404174 @917397390737 @919003386368  might had more crushes on them at school and college)

So this is a basic idea around this meetup. kindly share your POV about this if most of us are interested our community man will arrange accordingly.

I thought this might help us to step out of our responsibility shoes and go back to our old school and college days
(FYI  this is for you guys I am still in my college 🥲) <This message was edited>

25/04/25, 11:35 am - +91 99990 86253: Wow, okay. Maybe I needed this.

My life feels like completing a circle and taking a U-turn at the same time. 

Can't describe it day by day, but it has been just packing a place I called my home for a year, where I became independent.

I met people I didn't know I missed so much, but also the realisation that I failed to make some connections.

One good thing - I feel now easier to believe that I am a kind person, not in a bragging way, but in a good, impactful way, and I got it from my parents.

I am happy that my mom is coming to visit, and help me pack for a new home. 

Weird - time really, flies. So we really should be living everyday. 

I am getting back to my routine, accepting things, welcoming new ones, and ready to learn and make better connections.
25/04/25, 8:15 pm - +91 98408 29911: I forced myself to introduce in Deepak’s way.  This helps me to recollect few good moments and end of day felt happy 🙂 

Sunday - had good cricket, took 5 wickets and first time a six in off side (after that 7 dot balls 😂 ).  Watched Alappuzha Gymkhana with family, enjoyed it.

Monday - Submitted a proposal for a new development project, fingers crossed.  Vicky (my team member) bought his new bike - Royal Enfield Classic 500 Stealth Black 499cc, we went small ride and taken photo like as i own that :) 

Tuesday - Completely down - ramp down in staff aug project with note resource skill needs improvement.  

Wednesday - Had a call with Deepak, his kind words and guidance helped me a lot.  Sriram and Vicky guided me on where we are going wrong and how to fix that.  And we reach 200 entries mark for the state level badminton tournament we organise - https://tbpl.club/ 

Thursday - Travell to Mumbai for personal reason.  Life in chennai is better :) 

Friday - The app we developed for FIBDO approved in google and apple store, and released for UAT testing <This message was edited>
25/04/25, 8:39 pm - +91 86789 15148: Went offline again… yep, broke my 4th Twitter streak this year for sleeping more

Read 4 books while I was away... ( all rom -com) 

Finally started reading the book I begged my author friend for… after 3 months of emotional blackmail.

Didn’t text many people. 
Socially away... 

Work? Getting extended. 
Agency? Basically on fire.

Also had a mini war with my best friend (we are running our agency.for the first time).

FINNNally got 2 plants for our home and now I have 5 flowers for myself. 

Too many things happened. Brain = fullyy loaded.

But dreamy books and my hubby helped me stay *somewhat* sane.

Now off to make pasta for dinner(after thinking what to prepare after 2 hours)


P. S: tried day wise and after Tuesday... Directly Friday came so undated version
25/04/25, 9:24 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Hello DNA. 

This was one of those weeks where I forgot which day it is or which time it is because of work. First time witnessing two sunrises without sleep 

Promised myself I’d produce 1 reel a day and had to fully take it down cuz of client work. 

Managed to atleast do one social media blast every day. 

Twitter slightly took off. Finally seeing impressions go. 

2 agencies also reposted our stuff. 

Worked an expansion deal with our healthy ageing brand client. Email marketing + newsletters.

Working on launching a full fledged reel blast with another wellness client. I took a look and they’re gonna be a GAME CHANGER in precision diets. 

Missed 4 deadlines this week though because of an absolute mess. Currently working on fixing it, 

but man it’s fun to work under pressure.

Also missed a couple of sales opportunities due to client work. But again - SIGNED CLIENTS > Potential clients 

We’re also expanding our capability. Now moving into Google Ads management as a service, starting purely with search only. 

Hiring a copywriter + designer is one of the best moves I made. We’re having a machine gun built for SEO. Already started getting inbounds. 

Did it RIGHT AWAY after SSR advised me to do it during that meet up in Spacemush

Got my mental integrity challenged by that inbound lead which I lost to, which means it’s time for me to zoom out, hop back on an ashwagandha cycle and decompress more.

Saddest moment was my espresso machine dying out. Got a replacement which is this stovetop coffee maker. For now, that’s our stop gap measure but we’ll get an Italian handmade machine once I clear a bunch of obligations. 

Good results come to those keep working irrespective of the end outcome.

Finally will take a break tomorrow at 888.vc <This message was edited>
25/04/25, 11:52 pm - +91 99004 83828: Hello ppl 
Karthik here 

So this week unexpectedly turned out to be good I would say it’s the breaking point to come out of my lows and while I was searching for job opportunities after I closed my Ed venture and my job at adobe 

I came across bunch of opportunities to work closely with founders of growth stage start ups and eventually they paid me decent for the work I did for them in the space of product marketing 
And a lot of things came to me effortlessly and one such was esoft labs client 

Infact I am making good money & satisfied as well

This week was week of gratitude and new re entry

26/04/25, 5:22 pm - +91 77085 78300: I start my work at 11:30 am but when I see a message in my office group at morning 08 am even if it’s not intended for me , I get into that flight mode , I am trying to overcome that but it’s tough
26/04/25, 5:22 pm - Mahesh *CFC: We should have a secret gang sign
26/04/25, 5:23 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: Very tough. Never been able to do it, despite being at the most amazing places on Earth. 

If this is being taught at DNA School, I'd sign up in a jiffy
26/04/25, 5:24 pm - Rodick: Petition to record the insightful conversations we have at DNA and put it on social media.  Most of the  convos would have more info than shitty so called panel discussions

26/04/25, 5:25 pm - +91 75502 39842: Texting each other on WhatsApp talking about how shitty are the questions
26/04/25, 5:25 pm - +91 75502 39842: Agreed
26/04/25, 5:26 pm - Mahesh *CFC: It’s like giving a retard prompt to AI and getting a bad reply
26/04/25, 5:26 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Not the speaker fault tbh. They’ll surely be good if you drill into their “inner child” like Deepak says
26/04/25, 5:26 pm - LS - icrewsystems.com: I swear. 

@919884677563 and I felt something very similar at the Dubai AI Festival.
26/04/25, 5:28 pm - Mahesh *CFC: https://x.com/mahesh_s117/status/1916092293032890822?s=48
26/04/25, 5:28 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Go over this man.
26/04/25, 5:28 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Gestation cycle

26/04/25, 5:30 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Are we making a baby or flying a plane or what 

GET TO THE FUCKING POINT. COME ON. ARGHHHH
26/04/25, 5:31 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: What’s happening there
26/04/25, 5:32 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I think 888.vc or something.
26/04/25, 5:32 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Next time when you go to some event, post about it in advance.. rally more of us there… remember this: one of us sees the end of the light, everybody gets through
26/04/25, 5:32 pm - Rodick: BS. tats what's happening
26/04/25, 5:32 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Sure.
26/04/25, 5:32 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Be a proper DNAian
26/04/25, 5:33 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Yeah thank god we didn’t post lol.
26/04/25, 5:33 pm - Rodick: Use aws or gcp to build saas

Enable encryption 


People: wohhhhhoo insightful 😘
26/04/25, 5:33 pm - Rodick: @917550239842 anna put it right <This message was edited>
26/04/25, 5:33 pm - Mahesh *CFC: But I think what’ll make these bad events good is our gang being together.
26/04/25, 5:33 pm - Mahesh *CFC: And some man said gestation cycles are supported by tailwinds in the ecosystem.
26/04/25, 5:34 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Get @919884774776 on stage. He’s there. He can talk.
26/04/25, 5:34 pm - Mahesh *CFC: I wish.

28/04/25, 5:19 pm - Mahesh *CFC: 5 tweets a day keeps the (redacted) away
28/04/25, 5:38 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: For the past six months, I was pitching my product completely wrong. But I did one thing right: I saved every customer conversation, every 1-1 chat, and put them all into a document. One night, frustrated, I uploaded the whole doc into ChatGPT and asked, "What am I doing wrong?" The response is Flabbergasting. It showed me exactly where I was off. The gaps in how I thought versus how my customers thought. I changed my positioning, rewrote the landing page copy, and fixed my messaging. The next three conversations I had were all positive. AI is not replacing me. It’s solving my problems faster than I ever could. Who said AI is taking jobs away? It’s going to create new ones.
28/04/25, 5:39 pm - Mahesh *CFC: Lovely. This is a legit powerful use case in positioning + marketing. 

What model did you use brother?
28/04/25, 5:39 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: <Media omitted>
28/04/25, 5:46 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Seriously, this is too powerful. This would have taken me months. Calls with bunch of experts. This has saved time, energy and cost. All that was needed— change in positioning. From “Building Accountability in Groups” to “Running Your Group on Auto Pilot”. Because that’s exactly what the tool is doing, and it is doing it by keeping everyone accountable but that’s not what we are supposed to pitch. Pitch the end result! Bonfire saves you time and effort goes into running groups.
28/04/25, 5:52 pm - +91 82485 54880: I think you should try bonfire here in DNA group......



I know it's in your plan 😊
28/04/25, 5:53 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Yep, it’s in plan… The AI insights is a work in progress, we are almost. Once done, getting us there..
28/04/25, 5:54 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I have onboarded more than fifteen groups, each one of them trying out, giving us bunch of ideas.. we are sitting on something powerful here… bonfire will be our sole focus for the next two years.
28/04/25, 5:56 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I’ll dedicate a percentage of bonfire revenue to power its own users . I’m thinking more like digital stocks. So finally, when bonfire gets sold (acquired), everyone who uses it also gets to cash in for being early users.
28/04/25, 7:57 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Just now onboarded @918447545891 Indie Mastermind community onto Bonfire 🔥🥳🥳🥳🥳 Ayush, thanks and text me anytime you need any kind of support or run into a issue.

29/04/25, 7:30 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: 18 years of age, and the confidence he spoke with, I was mind blown. Where do these people come from da? Pah. The fluency, clarity, and then in the end he says, he has got to go prepare for his upcoming exams and leaves the call. 🤣

30/04/25, 1:05 pm - +91 94429 30787: Yes na! We are here 💪🏼
30/04/25, 1:30 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I rewatched the DNA documentary with a few friends last night and honestly, it broke my heart a little. They were so hooked, couldn’t stop talking about it, and all I kept thinking was—damn, they missed the real thing, the live experience. Every single day once I rethink about the theatre experience we had, that sound, claps, whistle. @919629392810 team created a beast of a film, something truly special, and what did I do? Barely pushed it. Just 1,000 views. It kills me. For the first time in my life, I wished I had more reach, maybe even fame not for the flex, but so more people could feel what we felt. I’m scared it’ll get buried under time. It’s too good to be forgotten. I’m heart broken.
30/04/25, 1:34 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Whatever happens from here, I will have some regret, anger, frustration, and disappointment in some corner of my mind with regards to this. Something to take to my grave.

02/05/25, 6:03 pm - Ar.Sameer: Is this N8N? 

If I know it is the one, I'm satisfied. Haha 

May I ask which problem this is you're solving too?

All hail Google firebase studio
02/05/25, 6:51 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Wow! This looks neat! Are you doing this a service to outsiders Saravanan?
02/05/25, 6:53 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: I suggest you buy a domain “Goodenoughlandingpages.com” — list it out a service. For $99 you deliver it in five days and $199 in 24 hours. The promise is Good enough, fast. Over a period of time, you can launch something like loveable that replaces you because you got the users and traffic. That’s how mailchimp started. First they built websites that take emails and write newsletter. Now that’s a software that replaced that team and prints money monthly.
02/05/25, 6:56 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: And don’t think anybody could do this. Maybe you’re right, anybody could but they won’t. That’s where business lies.
02/05/25, 6:57 pm - Saran Alagarswamy: thalaivaa..
02/05/25, 7:05 pm - Saravanan cloudenginelabs.io: Yes @917397390737 this is new service I’m launching in this month as part of my new offering.

02/05/25, 7:11 pm - Saravanan cloudenginelabs.io: This is one of best business advice i got in recent times .. definitely I’ll take action immediately.

04/05/25, 10:49 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: Today’s learning, lessons. Life isn’t to win. The point isn’t to succeed. But .. to live. Today I spent the day interviewing a dozen people for the weekend school. I can group them into two kinds. I’m just going to talk about the good kind. Why bother the other and spoil our peace. I simply told them “I’ll get back to you” you know what that means. The good kind, I came across someone with PhD, Doctrate, and when u asked what do you want to learn here, he spoke 10 complete minutes listing the things to learn. I encountered plenty trying to impress me, listing their wins. Maybe that’s how other schools in town pick their students, but not me, not the weekend school. We are happy with the outliers, the one who prove nothing to nobody, just pure hunger to live and learn.
04/05/25, 10:51 pm - Deepak Kumar DNA: With the kind of approval rate we have right now, I don’t see the classroom size crossing 10.
