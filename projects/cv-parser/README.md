I need a simple CV parser, written in nodeJS. 

- Should read CV PDF files in the /candidates folder 
- Should convert the PDF to a JSON file, which should have a common structure. 
- Screening: It should automatically reject if the candidate does not have a bachelors degree in computer science and store the rejected candidates in a /rejected-candidates folder. 
- For the candidates who have a desired degree, it should write a customised e-mail and also generate 5 follow up questions for the interviewing officer.
